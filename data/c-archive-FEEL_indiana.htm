The Canadian online magazine FEELguide.com recently 
published a piece about Christopher's involvement in the first 
publication of a newly discovered  Brahms piano piece, which he titled <i>Albumblatt</i>.
  Christopher is colourfully depicted as "one-part world renowned 
musicologist and one-part Indiana Jones", escaping ancient ruins from 
unfathomable terrors, fighting off venomous snakes and saving damsels in
 distress, all to bring us a newly discovered work by Brahms.
