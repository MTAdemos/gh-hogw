In the last few weeks, Christopher has been showered 
with medals after middle-European concerts! His final concert for the 
present season with the Poznan Philharmonic took place in Gniezno 
Cathedral, celebrating the 1000th anniversary of Emperor Otto III's 
pilgrimage to the tomb of St Wojciech. After the concert the head of the
 Polish Church, Archbishop Jozef Kowalczyk (who was also celebrating his
 birthday and 50 years of service) presented Christopher with the 
millenium medal of Gniezno and in addition the Papal Medal of John Paul 
II.

One week later, in the Budapest Opera House, the Philharmonic Orchestra 
enrolled him in their Golden Book (along with the signatures of Strauss,
 Stravinsky, Bart&#243;k, Kodaly and almost every other famous name from the 
past century and a half) and presented him with their 150th anniversary 
medal.

More of this and a special cabinet will be needed in Cambridge.</p>

The Pozna&#324; Philharmonic Orchestra, of which Christopher is Principal 
Guest Conductor, opened the Gniezno Cathedral concert on 18 March with 
Joseph Haydn's final symphony, No.104 in D major, the "London Symphony".
  To perform Haydn's solemn Nelson Mass, the orchestra was joined by the
 Polish Chamber Choir Schola Cantorum Gedanensis, the Pozna&#324; Boys Choir 
and four outstanding soloists (Marta Boberska <i>soprano</i>, Urszula Kryger <i>mezzo-soprano</i>, Markus Sch&#228;fer <i>tenor</i> and Wojtek Gierlach <i>bass</i>).
  The works were performed in front of the magnificent backdrop of the 
altar of Gniezno Cathedral, which holds the lavish silver tomb of St 
Wojciech.

After the concert, the Mayor of Gniezno, Jacek Kowalski, awarded 
Christopher the medal of the 1000th anniversary of the Congress of 
Gniezno and the Papal Medal of John Paul II.
