<p>
An annual London celebration of the patron saint of music, in the form 
of a banquet plus the performance of an ode, was instituted on St 
Cecilia's Day, 22 November 1683. The occasion proved so popular that it 
continued for some 30 years after. A newspaper account of the first 
performance of the 1692 Ode informs us that 'the Ode was admirably set 
to music by Mr. Henry Purcell, and perform'd twice with universal 
applause'. The popularity of Purcell's setting is apparent from the many
 sources that survive from the period and from printed extracts which 
appeared almost immediately after its first performance.

For this new <a href="http://www.schott-music.com/shop/1/show,252295.html">Eulenburg</a>
 edition in Purcell's anniversary year Christopher has utilised several 
sources which have only recently come to light, and included in 
Appendices the transposed settings of three of the most popular vocal 
solos which are found in Purcell's own hand adapted for voice and 
continuo.

Christopher's edition of the <a href="http://www.schott-music.com/shop/1/show,47501.html">10 Sonatas in Four Parts</a> 
is also available from the same publisher.</p>
