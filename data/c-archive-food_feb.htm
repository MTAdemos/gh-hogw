 Food Counter has been in abeyance for a while, but needs to be revived 
this month in order to mention the Leipzig restaurant MEDICI which 
provided me with almost daily meals in a quiet and civilised atmosphere 
for more than 5 weeks at the beginning of this year while I was working 
for the Leipzig Opera. It is hidden in a small quiet square beside the 
St Nicholas Church (one of Bach&#8217;s churches, where the Christmas Oratorio
 was first heard), and in summer you can sit outside on the pavement.

<img class="imgright" src="upload/478x438_darkroom4.jpg">Despite
 being called Medici, it deals with more than Italian cuisine (one chef 
is German, one from the Seychelles), has a constantly changing menu and 
wine-selection (by the glass also) and every day a new &#8220;Medici-Teller&#8221; 
which makes an excellent one-course lunch for &#8364;15. Lunch and evening 
menus are different, all offer a few &#8220;fusion&#8221; dishes (often spiced, or 
with coconut milk, or a hundred ways of serving calamaretti, of which 
the restaurant seems to have a uniquely tender supply).
</p><p>
On weekdays it draws a business and arts clientele (Mrs Masur was eating
 there when I first visited, several soloists from the Gewandhaus on 
other days, plus actors and writers), but is not overcrowded; there is 
an ingenious upper floor inserted into what must originally have been a 
very plain space. On Saturdays it attracts families (an air of <i>Kindergarten</i>,
 but not overwhelming), and if you move quickly after an opera or 
concert finishes, you can get there comfortably before last orders &#8212; a 
real surprise in Leipzig, where places tend to close early. On Sundays, 
alas, it is shut.
