After some busy marmalade-making by the Brookside Collective in early January, we entered some 
pots into <a href="http://www.dalemainmarmaladeawards.co.uk/" title="The World" s="" original="" marmalade="" awards'="">The World's Original Marmalade Awards</a>
 competition in Cumbria. Christopher was very pleased (and a little 
surprised) to receive an award of merit for his contribution to the 
'Man-made Seville Orange Marmalade' category.
