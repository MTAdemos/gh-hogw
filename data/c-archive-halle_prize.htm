Christopher has been selected as this year's recipient of the Honorary
Handel Prize from the City of Halle (Saale), in Germany. The award

 life and works of George Friedrich Handel. Christopher's Handel
projects for 2007 included rare concert performances of the opera
Amadigi, the publication of an important edition of Handel's 8 Suites
for keyboard HWV426-433 (adapted by Gottlieb Muffatt), and the release
of a revised version of Christopher's classic biography of Handel.
Projects in 2008 include performances of Flavio with the Academy of
Ancient Music, an edition of the Musick for the Royal Fireworks, and
also Handel's 6 Fugues for keyboard (adapted by Gottlieb Muffatt). This

of timpani and percussion, from the Michaelstein Conference.</p>
