The CD features a <a href="inst-fortepiano.htm">fortepiano</a> 
by Joseph Brodmann (Vienna, <i>c.</i>1815)
 from Christopher's instrument collection, which is associated with 
Weber during his years in Prague as Director of the Estates Theatre 
(1813&#8211;1816), and which was later part of the collection of historic 
instruments belonging to the celebrated Czech singer, Ema Destinnov&#225; 
(Emmy Destinn, 1878&#8211;1930).
</p><p>
Since it cannot be claimed with certainty that any extant piano work was
 conceived at this Brodmann piano, the programme for this, the 
instrument&#8217;s debut recording, is drawn from amongst the works Weber had 
already completed prior to his arrival in Prague, works which were part 
of the experience that informed his selection of the instruments he kept
 there and which he may have played at these instruments for his own 
recreation.
</p><p>
The programme includes Weber's Piano Sonata No. 1 in C major Op. 24 and <i>Variations on an Original Theme</i> Op. 2, as well as Six Pieces for Piano Duet Op. 10 with Christopher joining Duncan at the fortepiano.
