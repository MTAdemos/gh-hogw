In September 2001 Christopher returned to Magnano, in the hills between 
Turin and Milan, to participate in the meeting of the International 
Clavichord Society of which he is, with Bernard Brauchli, co-chairman. 
The biennial symposium began in 1993 and involves makers &#8212; who arrive 
with and demonstrate their instruments &#8212; and musicologist-players who 
perform and present papers on the clavichord repertoire. These are then 
gathered together in the journal <i>De Clavicordio</i> which appears in the fallow year between two Magnano meetings.

Christopher brought to the conference the fruits of his researches into 
Danish music-making from the early eighteenth century into the first 
third of the next. This period saw the transformation of the instrument 
from the humble learning-aid, to which King Christian IV put his 
children in 1626&#8211;7, into a vehicle for the creative imagination: notably
 under the hands of Holberg&#8217;s friend C. A. Thielo, and his successors 
for whom the Hamburg Bach, clavichordist as well as symphonist, was a 
beacon light. S&#246;nnichsen almost became his pupil, and Zinck succeeded in
 being one. Mozart&#8217;s widow Constanze, married to the diplomat Georg 
Nissen, wrote from Copenhagen in 1810 that with the arrival of her Stein
 pianoforte ordered from Vienna inevitably delayed till next year, she 
would just have to make do with her clavichord; and one last example was
 being sought in a newspaper small-ad as late as 1842. Zinck followed C.
 P. E. Bach&#8217;s example in his six carefully planned yet visionary sonatas
 of 1783, allowing one of them to end, unexpectedly, in a song-setting. 
In Christopher&#8217;s estimation, German and native clavichordists played a 
major part in the creation of Copenhagen&#8217;s vibrant musical scene around 
1780, and their work is sufficiently interesting in a European context 
to merit further investigation.
