Last week Christopher conducted a unique programme of 
music with the Poznan Philharmonic Orchestra, setting Classical works by
 Mozart and Schubert alongside the minimalist masterpiece 'In C' by 
Terry Riley.

Taking the theme of 'C' for the concert, Riley's work nestled in between
 two other great works in the same key, the Overture from Mozart's <i>La Clemenza di Tito</i>
 and Schubert's Symphony No. 9.    Riley's work, often considered to be 
the first minimalist composition, was written in 1964 for any number of 
performers and any combination of instruments.  As can be seen in the 
photos below, an unusual array of instruments took part in Christopher's
 interpretation, including a banjo, a mandolin, an accordion and a 
digital keyboard.  The piece consists of 53 numbered musical phrases and
 being a semi-aleotoric work, each musician has control over which 
phrase he or she plays.  Since In C has no fixed duration, performances 
can last between 15 minutes and several hours, but given the length of 
Schubert's 'Great' Symphony No.9, this foray into the world of 
minimalism was limited to 20 minutes.
