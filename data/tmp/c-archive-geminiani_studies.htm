 collection of essays by leading scholars from various fields, this book
 provides a long overdue look at Francesco Geminiani's life and works 
from numerous viewpoints. Included is a Preface and essay by 
Christopher, 'Geminiani and Fine Art', which assesses Geminiani's (often
 ridiculed, but highly successful) dealings in artworks. Below is the 
abstract from the book.

This publication runs alongside Ut Orpheus' on-going <a href="http://www.francescogeminiani.com/" title="<i>Francesco Geminiani Opera Omnia</i>">

Sixteen essays by international scholars celebrate the 250th anniversary
 of Francesco Geminiani (1687-1762), star pupil of Corelli and composer,
 performer and teacher in Paris, London and Dublin, who for many years 
was ranked as the equal of Handel.

</p><p>
His compositions moved far beyond Corelli&#8217;s model (to include theatre 
music, sonatas for cello and keyboard works) and later in his life he 
supported his aesthetic style with treatises on violin and guitar 
playing, good taste, accompaniment and composition. He published all his
 output in the most elegant style via engravers and music sellers in 
Paris, Amsterdam and London, and constantly revised and rewrote earlier 
works in new and often expanded formats. This legacy is analysed and 
placed in context within the various national styles current in Europe, 
and the enormous influence of his treatise <i>The Art of Playing on the Violin</i> is positioned in a continuum which extends to Ivan Galamian.

</p><p>
	Outside music these studies examine the effect of Freemasonry on 
Geminiani&#8217;s career, and his frequent recourse to law to defend his 
rights. On his own admission, Geminiani preferred dealing in fine art to
 playing the violin &#8212; a claim always derided by earlier writers, but in 
fact easily defended by newly available evidence of his highly 
successful sales.

</p><p>
	The reception of Geminiani&#8217;s music is also re-assessed and his apparent
 decline in public favour is explained; many new sources contradict the 
accepted and dismissive opinions of Charles Burney and John Hawkins, and
 the supportive enthusiasm of his main British advocate, Charles Avison,
 is given its rightful position. Questions of present-day performance 
values are also contrasted with Geminiani&#8217;s philosophy, and many leads 
presented for the future investigation of this enigmatic but individual 
genius.
