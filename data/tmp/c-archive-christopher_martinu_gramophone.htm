In July's issue, <a href="http://www.gramophone.co.uk/"><i>Gramophone</i></a>
 continues its series of 'The Real Great Composers' with a half-hour, 
cover-disc interview between Christopher and James Jolly on Martin&#367;.
</p><p>
Arguably Martin&#367; would be enjoying greater exposure in his anniversary 
year were he not sharing it with Purcell, Handel, Haydn and Mendelssohn;
 but Christopher has long been an admirer, with numerous recordings to 
his name, and a place among the Board of Editors of the Bohuslav Martin&#367;
 Foundation, currently preparing the Complete Edition of the composer&#8217;s 
works.

</p><p>
Christopher's first Martin&#367; recording, <i>Martin&#367; - Works for Chamber Orchestra</i>,
 with the St Paul Chamber Orchestra, was released by Decca in 1993.  A 
recent review by David Hurwitz has revived interest in this seminal 
recording.  To read the review click <a href="http://goodman940.blogspot.com/2009/08/martinu-works-for-chamber-orchestra.html" title="here">here</a>.</p><p></p>
