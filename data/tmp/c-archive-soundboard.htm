Christopher has been a longstanding supporter of St. 
Cecilia's Hall and Museum in Edinburgh, which houses one of the most 
significant collection of musical instruments in Britain.  For the 40th 
anniversary edition of Soundboard, the newsletter of the Friends of St. 
Cecilia's Hall and Museum, Christopher gave an interview which can be 
read in full below.

My earliest music memory is of my mother playing Bach partitas on the 
piano; she was a good amateur pianist and had met my father when singing
 in the London Bach Choir. After the War, and with a large family to 
bring up they were not able to continue with this, but all five of us 
children had a music education learning instruments and I was also a 
choirboy. 
</p><p>
<b>What sparked your interest in early music &#8211; was this during your studies at Pembroke or later? </b><br>
I was interested in historical keyboard music when I was at school; I 
think perhaps I had heard George Malcolm in concert, but I certainly 
sought out harpsichords. When I went up to Cambridge I initially read 
Classics, but tired of this and took music courses. Working with 
colleagues such as David Munrow (with whom I founded the Early Music 
Consort) shaped my early musical career further. 
</p><p>
<b>You have worked with many musicians and musicologists over the years, are there any you would pick out as particular influences?</b><br>
In terms of tuition, I would have to say that a number of my teachers 
have shaped my career, including Raphael Puyana and George Malcolm. The 
Cambridge based harpsichordist Mary Potts was particularly influential 
as a teacher; I even lived in her house for a while and particularly 
enjoyed playing her Schudi-Broadwood harpsichord of c.1775, which had 
formerly belonged to Arnold Dolmetsch whose son Rudolph had been her 
teacher. One cannot of course omit the great Gustav Leonhardt from the 
list of influential teachers, although what you may not have known was 
that he shared Raymond Russell&#8217;s love of fast cars! Thurston Dart was 
also an important figure in my early career, in that he proved that it 
was possible to combine a successful academic career with a performing 
one and that the two complemented each other.
</p><p>
<b>How did you first discover the Russell collection? </b><br>
Mary Potts was a friend of Raymond Russell, so I knew his book on the 
harpsichord and clavichord and his collection before it moved up to St 
Cecilia&#8217;s Hall. I would like to return to Edinburgh when time allows, to
 see the Russell Collection again, but also to see the Mirrey and Sir 
Nicholas Shackleton Collections, as I knew both of these in their former
 homes.
</p><p>
<b>How did you start putting your own instrument collection together&#8230;?</b><br>
Like most performers, my first instrument was bought as a playing 
instrument. I had connections with Ann Feldburg&#8217;s workshop in Kent and I
 borrowed and later bought an instrument from her for my general 
performing needs. Having worked through the available modern instruments
 and having been able to play Mary Potts&#8217; eighteenth-century 
instruments, I eventually acquired a single-manual Kirckman harpsichord 
and built my collection up from there. I am particularly fond of the 
clavichord, and have a number of fine examples. It is also easier to 
collect original clavichords, whereas highly decorated or important 
harpsichords are now far beyond the reach of the average performer&#8217;s 
budget. 
</p><p>
<b>&#8230; and is there anything you would particularly like to acquire for it if you had unlimited funds? </b><br>
It would have to depend on what music I was playing at the time the 
unlimited funds appeared! If I were playing Scarlatti I might have one 
shopping list that would be entirely different should I be playing music
 by another composer&#8230;
</p><p>
<b>Do you often get requests for musicians for access to your collection? </b><br>
Surprisingly few; although at the moment we are in the middle of 
building work, I would like to encourage performers or musicologists to 
use my collection as there are some fine instruments, including a piano 
formerly owned by Weber. 
</p><p>
The University of Cambridge are building up their interest in early 
music after a period when it was less popular, and now have a baroque 
orchestra and a Handel opera society. Unfortunately, the University had 
already sold much of its instrument collection so it would be nice to 
encourage students to make some use of my own collection.
</p><p>
Cambridge Professors such as John Rink, whose particular interest is the
 music of Chopin, are encouraging a return to the idea of historically 
informed performance. We need to break down the philosophic stance that 
this belongs only to the baroque and classical periods (or earlier) and 
recognise that it is equally important to consider instrumentation in 
the music of Stravinsky or Brahms as it is for Mozart or Bach.
</p><p>
There is so much about historically informed performance and the 
development of instruments that we as musicologists, organologists, or 
so-called early musicians think has been &#8216;discovered&#8217;, but this is 
unfamiliar to the concert going public or even to the general musician. 
Making instrument collections available to performers to discover for 
themselves is one of the ways we can encourage more thought on the 
matter.
</p><p>
<b>You perform a wide variety of styles of music, is there anyone you would pick out as a favourite composer? </b><br>
No- it seems as wrong to pick out a favourite composer, as it would be 
to pick a favourite pupil- they should all be enjoyed for their 
individual merits. 
</p><p>
<b>What are your plans for future performances and lectures? </b><br>
One of the joys of being both academic and performer is that the two are
 so interrelated: I am especially involved in work on editions of 
Mendelssohn and Martin&#367;, and the best test of an edition (and the best 
way to find any mistakes) is to play it.
</p><p>
<b>Which piece of music plays continuously in hell? </b><br>
All unasked for music is hell! I am very much a supporter of the 
campaign to get rid of background music as it devalues the idea of 
listening to it and concentrating. I also wonder what the physical 
effects of so many people wandering around with loud music being piped 
directly into their ears by headphones. 
</p><p>
<b>&#8230; and in heaven? </b><br>
The sheer joy of music is that there is such a huge variety to choose 
from; there is no universally perfect piece, and anything would soon 
become hell if listened to on a constant loop.
</p><p>
<b>What would your epitaph be? </b><br>
Perhaps I could paraphrase John Kitchen&#8217;s choice and say, &#8220;A general pause is a joy forever&#8221;.<br>
