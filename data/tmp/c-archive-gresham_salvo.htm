<p>
How to be revolutionary without scaring away your public? How to 
announce yourself as a new broom without alienating the more stalwart 
connoisseurs? Beethoven faced these problems when presenting his first 
six string quartets for publication as opus 18; did he win his public 
and allay their fears with his choice of opening? The Wilhelm Quartet 
will present the evidence.<br>
</p><p>
The Wilhelm Quartet comprises Marciana Buta (violin), Charlotte Skinner (violin), Daisy Spiers (viola) and Hetty Snell (cello).<br>
</p><p>
This is a part of Christopher's 2011&#8211;12 series of lectures, <i>The Making of a Masterpiece</i>,
 in which he examines a number of acknowledged masterpieces, but each 
from a select angle only - their scoring, compactness, virtuosity, 
accessibility, memorability or other flavour.
