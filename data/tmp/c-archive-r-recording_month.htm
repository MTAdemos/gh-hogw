A re-release of Christopher's recording of keyboard music by Orlando 
Gibbons (Catalogue Number: EXP 0006) has been named 'Recording of the 
month' on the MusicWeb International website. This is the first release 
on CD of Christopher's recording from 1975 of 22 pieces for keyboard by 
Gibbons.
</p><p>
The review, by Michael Greenhalgh, on the website sums this up as 'the 
classic recording of Gibbons keyboard music with playing unsurpassed by 
its successors'. To read the full review and see a full list of works

The recording has been issued by Explore Records &#8212; a new label that is 
releasing recordings that have been unavailable for a long time. Their 
initial releases are taken from the Decca catalogue, so watch out for 
any more of Christopher's recordings which may appear&#8230;.
