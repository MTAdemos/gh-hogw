After several years' gestation, the first volume of 
Christopher's edition of the Complete Sonatas for Keyboard by Leopold 
Ko&#382;eluch (1747-1818) is finally published by 
<a href="http://www.sheetmusic.cz/en/news/czech-music-new-urtext-publications-and-critical-editions-2010.html">Editio

 the end of the eighteenth century Ko&#382;eluch was the composer "most 
celebrated in all of musical Europe" for reasons summed up by Charles 
Burney: "His style is more easy than that of Emanuel Bach, Haydn or 
Mozart; it is natural, graceful, flowing", "pleasing" and "pure". For 
more than a quarter of a century he defined the musical tastes of the 
aristocracy and general public alike, in the music capital of the world,
 Vienna.<br>
</p><p>
However, his very accessibility has been the cause of his subsequent 
neglect; after his death fashion had moved on and "pleasing" became a 
dismissal, and more recent musical scholarship has preferred to focus on
 the great masters of the period. <br>
</p><p>
In his Introduction, Christopher discusses Ko&#382;eluch's place in musical 
history, not only as a composer whose sonatas display to perfection 
precisely the features required of a sonata by theorists of the period, 
but also as innovator in his own right; both his anticipation of 
Beethoven's and Schubert's tragic-pathetic manner, and his creation of 
the f&#234;ted <i>cantabile</i> idiom, have been seen as chance if not 
overlooked entirely, along with his frequent, less easily-defined 
harmonic adventurism. His preference for the fortepiano over the 
harpsichord and clavichord also marks a significant break with the past;
 his writing is highly idiomatic to the newer instrument.<br>
</p><p>
<img src="upload/kozvol1.jpg" alt="kozvol1.jpg" class="imgleft" height="252" width="197">The
 four-volume series presents the sonatas chronologically, the first 
volume covering the period 1780-1784; Volume II (1784-86) is expected 
later this year. The internationally-accepted spelling "Ko&#382;eluch" has 
been retained, the variant "Ko&#382;eluh" being only a more recent 
development, though one favoured by many modern-day Czechs. As well as 
Christopher's Introduction, this Urtext edition provides facsimiles and 
full critical notes, as well as a thematic index to the series.
