    <div class="title">New edition of Muffat's <i>Componimenti Musicali</i>, the source of so much Handel</div>
    <div class="date">December 17, 2009</div>
    <div class="leader">
To counterbalance his 2007 and 2008 editions of Handel's keyboard 
<a href="http://www.utorpheus.com/utorpheus/product_info.php?products_id=1565"><i>Suites</i></a> and 
<a href="http://www.utorpheus.com/utorpheus/product_info.php?products_id=1794"><i>Fugues</i></a> as 'improved' 
by Gottlieb Muffat (1690-1770), Christopher's latest publication is of Muffat's own <i>Componimenti Musicali</i>, the
keyboard collection of 1739 plundered so often by Handel, in particular for his <i>Ode for St Cecilia's Day</i> composed
later that year. This new edition, once again with 
<a href="http://www.utorpheus.com/utorpheus/product_info.php?products_id=2088">Ut Orpheus Edizioni</a>, features the
transcription of an additional manuscript suite comprising early versions of three movements found in the
<i>Componimenti</i> and four movements previously unpublished.

If Handel 'took other men's pebbles and polished 
them into diamonds' (Boyce), he chose to work with some already 
remarkable quarry: the <i>Componimenti Musicali</i> was, according to 
Chrysander, 'one of the very best harpsichord works of the age', its 
material borrowed by Handel not only for the <i>Ode</i> but also for, among others, <i>Samson</i>, <i>Joshua</i> and the 
<i>Concerti Grossi Op. 6</i>.

</p><p>
Despite its ultra-modest title &#8212; simply <i>Musical Compositions</i> &#8212; Muffat himself described the 1739 publication of his <i>Componimenti Musicali</i>
 as 'the most beautiful product to be met with in all Germany'. It was 
patently one of the most lavish and cosmopolitan productions of all 
18th-century music printing; with paper of large format and high 
quality, an extravagant title-page, meticulous and calligraphic 
engraving, prefaces in several languages and a dedication to the Holy 
Roman Emperor, Muffat aimed to set it apart from other volumes of 
keyboard music of this period such as Couperin's <i>Pi&#232;ces de Clavecin</i> or Bach's <i>Klavier&#252;bung</i>, and also from his earlier collection of versetts and toccatas aimed at the professional church musician (<i>72 Versetl sammt 12 Toccaten</i>, Vienna, 1726). The <i>Componimenti</i>
 represent a polished selection from his secular keyboard music and the 
publication was directed at the royal household. His title-page proudly 
announces that he was not only <i>Organista di Corte e Camera</i> (i.e. in public and private) to the Emperor, but also 
<i>Maestro di Cembalo</i> to the two arch-duchesses, Maria Theresa and her sister Maria Anna.

Christopher's edition reproduces in facsimile the title- and dedicatory 
pages of the original print, and the additional manuscript suite, 
transcribed by kind permission of the <a href="http://www.sing-akademie.de/">Sing-Akademie zu Berlin</a>,
 reveals how carefully Muffat polished his own pebbles for a publication
 worthy not only of an Emperor but of Handel's flattering appropriation.

the harpsichord (Musica?) surrounded by putti playing guitar, violin, 
cello and (?) recorder. To the right are more rustic instruments 
(bagpipe, hurdy-gurdy, pan-pipes and a small alphorn) and at the top a 
medley of courtly brass, wind and stringed instruments.
