<img class="imgleft" src="upload/21591_2.jpg">On 15 and 17 April Christopher conducted performances of Handel&#8217;s opera <i>Flavio</i>
 with the Academy of Ancient Music (avid readers of the site will have 
read the recent article on these pages about Christopher&#8217;s appearance on
 BBC Radio 3&#8217;s &#8216;In Tune&#8217; programme). This was the second in 
Christopher&#8217;s three-year cycle of Handel operas with the AAM, with <i>Arianna</i> still to come in 2009. 
These reviews appeared following the concerts in Birmingham and London. <br clear="all">

 himself was sung by Iestyn Davies, one of a remarkable pair of 
countertenors (the other was Robin Blaze in a lovelorn role) to grace 
Tuesday&#8217;s performance in the exquisitely accommodating Town Hall. James 
Gilchrist, who seems everywhere at the moment, was vivid and 
vituperative as the put-upon Ugone&#8230;and Maite Beaumont was frank and 
open-voiced as her swain Vitige. But the plaudits must go the Karina 
Gauvin as Emilia (the opera&#8217;s originally-planned title), bitter and torn
 in her expression of wide-ranging emotion. Christopher Hogwood 
conducted an AAM of wonderfully sprung agility. Oboes cooed like 
turtle-doves, the flute cast a pastel spell, and the theorbo rasped 
tellingly in the well-paced recitatives. It was refreshing that there 
was no &#8220;listen to me&#8221; element to the appropriate ornamentation of da 
capo arias. This was an account all about drama.&#8217; <i>Christopher Morley</i>

&#8216;&#8230;Buoyantly
 conducted by Christopher Hogwood and vivaciously played by the Academy 
of Ancient Music, this performance had plenty of panache. Seven stylish 
soloists relished every note: invidiously, I would single out the 
elegant timbre of the countertenor Robin Blaze and the sumptuous soprano
 Karina Gauvin, whose deliquescent singing of two gorgeously melancholy 
arias in the second act was the evening&#8217;s musical highlight.&#8217; <i>Rupert Christiansen</i>

&#8216;&#8230;with 
the evergreen Christopher Hogwood conducting an on-form Academy of 
Ancient Music, this performance couldn&#8217;t be faulted for energy or 
stylishness. I have reservations about semi-staged concerts&#8230;But the 
countertenor Iestyn Davies as a firm-toned Flavio, the outstandingly 
intelligent Spanish mezzo Maite Beaumont as the resolute suitor Vitige, 
James Rutherford growling (&#8230;) as the vengeful courtier, Lotario, and 
James Gilchrist stealing the laughs as the perpetually affronted Ugone &#8211;
 all these sustained effective characterisations&#8230;
</p><p>
&#8230;Karina Gauvin proved to have an ardent voice and bags of appealing musicality.&#8217; <i>Richard Morrison</i>

And a comment from a <i>Times</i> reader:
</p><p>
<i>'I went to the Birmingham Town Hall performance of this concert and 
agree that whilst this is perhaps not Handel's best opera, the muscial 
execution was faultless to my ear. However, I disagree that the music 
was unnoteworthy and point out that a number of arias are generally 
accepted to be some of his best (or at least appear in compilation CDs 
titled as such) including 'Bel Contento'. The plot is slightly 
unbelievable, but it is a comic opera and therefore has to have an 
element of hilarity. Because of the fact the opera was unstaged, much of
 this comic impact may have been lost, except for the subtle use of 
small props and facial expressions. Overall it was a thoroughly 
enjoyable performance which I am sure could gain wider appeal if staged 
more regularly. The best singers in my opinion were Karina Gauvin and 
Robin Blaze.'

&#8216;As far as Handel operas go, there&#8217;s hardly a stone left unturned, and 
thanks are due in a large part to musicologist, harpsichordist and 
all-around Baroque-and-roller, Christopher Hogwood&#8230;
</p><p>
&#8230;The AAM accompanied a fine cast. Many will have been disappointed by 
the indisposition of Sandrine Piau, one of the most elegant of Baroque 
sopranos&#8230; but Karina Gauvin provided a more than adequate replacement in
 the role of Emilia. Renata Pokupic&#8217;s Teodata was enjoyable&#8230;but Maite 
Beaumont was more remarkable: her voice is big, bold (Broadway, almost) 
but sensitively deployed, and her delivery was pitched to perfection as 
the amorous young courtier, Vitige. Elsewhere, James Gilchrist sang well
 as Ugone, Robin Blaze&#8217;s smooth and nimble counter-tenor got a good 
work-out in the part of Guido, and Iestyn Davies (soon to play Ottone in
 Glyndebourne&#8217;s <i>L&#8217;incoronazione di Poppea</i>), though fruitier toned, was impressive nonetheless as the ill-fated Flavio.
</p><p>
Courtly flourishes, come-hither looks, and huffy departures from the 
music stand all helped to guide the audience through the plot and 
provided the odd moment of welcome humour. Three hours of little-known 
Handel might have been a daunting prospect for some&#8230;but Hogwood and his 
ensemble offered a confident, vivid, and engaging performance.&#8217; <i>Laura Battle</i>

</p><p>
'The Academy of Ancient Music's one-off performance of Handel's opera <i>Flavio</i>
 at the Barbican was a complete sell out. Packed to the rafters, the 
audience buzzed with excitement, waiting for the slightly altered 
line-up; Sandrine Piau was replaced at the last minute by Karina Gauvin.
 After what seemed a slightly rushed beginning &#8212; Christopher Hogwood 
starting up before the singers even has a chance to sit down it was an 
enthusiastic performance from Hagwood, with some beautifui ensemble 
playing from the AAM. 
</p><p>
As this is one of Handel's lesser-known operas, and one he is rumoured 
to have completed only a week before its first performance, there was a 
definite feeling within the audience of discovering something unknown 
and special. The plot to this tragicomedy is fairly simple &#8212; the normal 
scenario of love triangles and jealousy, a spot of murder and a neat 
reconciliation to tidy it all up at the end. However, the slight 
banality of the plot did not, in my opinion, take anything away from 
what is undeniably some sublime musical writing and a great performance.
 
</p><p>
Maite Beaumont (playing Vitage) and Renata Pokupic (playing Teodata) 
began with a beautifully balanced duet, and despite this being an 
unstaged performance, they interjected just enough acting, movement, and
 interaction between them to bring the plot and sentiments of the arias 
to life. This style was continued by each of the singers in turn, who 
successfully infused a sense of acting and drama into the performance. 
</p><p>
Robin Blaze (Guido) produced a confident and full countertenor tone with
 some beautifully flowing faster passages and persuasive acting. In line
 with the comical spirit of the opera and the relatively warm and 
relaxed atmosphere of this performance, there was a ripple of laughter 
from the audience as one of the oboists took on a momentary silent role,
 presenting an envelope to Guido. Still more laughter ensued as this 
envelope was revealed to contain a Proms-style British flag. Hogwood 
seemed entirely relaxed in his conducting. Indeed he seemed to be 
enjoying himself very much, demonstrating a strong relationship with the
 orchestra. He seemed to know the music so well, conducting not only 
from the score but from the heart. Intuitive conducting such as this is 
surely the leading force, inspiring a performance with such magical 
quality. 
</p><p>
His manipulation of the tempo was perfect at every change &#8212; whisking the
 audience up with the exhilaration of faster passages, and allowing the 
singers sufficient space in the slower arias to fully express the 
emotions within the text. Even on the occasion I feared too ambitious a 
pace had been set, it was never too much for the singers. James 
Gilchrist (Ugone) sang with great passion and vigour in his first aria, 
despite the breakneck pace set by the orchestra. The continuo playing 
was pleasantly tight throughout and particularly sensitively and 
expressively executed by cellist, Joseph Crouch. Although each of the 
singers contributed something different to the performance, one stood 
out for me above the others. Both the rich tone of Maite Beaumont's 
voice and her wonderful ability to express the emotions of her character
 made her performance truly captivating. Part of her success surely must
 lie in her freeness from the music &#8212; she barely glanced at the score 
during her arias. Others were much less confident in knowing the music, 
thus she had the edge in expressive communication. 
</p><p>
The death of Lotario, it's fair to say, definitely veered on the side of
 comedy rather than tragedy. Thankfully, this can only have been the way
 they intended it, and, probably given the friendly atmosphere of this 
performance, it was not a horribly comic experience but was in fact well
 received by the audience, who embraced the deliberately half-hearted 
depiction of his death. This joke was continued with a knowing laugh 
between audience and singer at the reappearance of Lotario at the 
d&#233;nouement of the opera to sing the final chorus with the rest of the 
cast. 
</p><p>
This comedic ending was representative of the mood of the evening as a 
whole &#8212; a stunning performance of some truly beautiful music but set 
within a warm, friendly atmosphere on stage that permeated into the 
audience. An audience that very much appreciated this combination too &#8212; 
rapturous applause resounded around the hall, in a way that was more 
effusive and genuine than I have heard in a very long time.' <i>Claudine Nightingale</i>

<b>Guardian:</b>
</p><p>
In an article by James Fenton on changing fortunes in Handel operas, the
 following passage noted the recent AAM performance at the Barbican:
</p><p>
'As for the operas, matters were even worse. The operas were dead. 
"Occasional attempts at revival, although revealing untold glories to 
musicians of sober and patient tastes, have only shown that there is no 
hope of ever restoring these works to a stage which no longer resorts to
 extravagant sumptuousness of production for its own sake, nor has any 
use for the stiff formality of endless successions of da capo arias."
</p><p>
Handel's fortune really was at its nadir when his supporters, not his 
detractors, spoke in this way. Blom goes on: "The fact is that Handel's 
operas are merely so many secular oratorios in costume, on the whole 
less dramatic than the oratorios themselves because they lack the choral
 climaxes, and that we might as well think of building flats and 
factories in the baroque manner as of putting them on stage again except
 occasionally and experimentally."
</p><p>
I was thinking of this passage during Christopher Hogwood's concert 
performance of Handel's Flavio, re de' Langobardi at the Barbican a few 
days ago. A succession, yes, although not an endless succession, of 
arias; a plot that was of no great concern to the audience; rather 
little recitative; but a fluent and unhesitating progression through the
 score, which came over like a succession of demonstrations: this is 
what it is like to be angry, to feel vengeful, to be in love, to mourn, 
to be triumphant. It was like an unfolding essay in the emotions, acted 
out both through the singing voices and through the descriptive power of
 the orchestration.
</p><p>
The practice of concert performances of rare operas, with or without 
some element of acting, of semi-staging (in this case largely confined 
to some interaction between the singers, according to the demands of the
 script) &#8212; how simple it all seemed to achieve. How unproblematic. How 
impossible (it would appear) to predict in 1935.' <i>James Fenton</i>
