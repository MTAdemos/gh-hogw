 the past two decades &#8220;the arrangement&#8221; has enjoyed something of a 
revival, which would surely be a source of delight to classical 
composers, although they would never have understood why it fell out of 
favour in the first place.
</p><p>
The present set of three string quartets, arranged from two violin 
sonatas and a piano trio, were originally published by Andr&#233; in Vienna 
in 1799. A certain independence is noticeable on the part of the 
anonymous arranger, but the results are strikingly successful, 
effectively adding three new works to the Mozart &#339;uvre and providing a 
welcome and gracious alternative for those quartet players who are 
seeking to move beyond the familiar, over-exposed repertoire.
