<img class="imgleft" src="upload/OperLeipzig.jpg">There have been many reviews of <i>La Cemenza di Tito</i>
 in the German press. Here are four extracts of reviews, translated into
 English by James Day. 
<br clear="all">

</p><p>
<b>Leipziger Volkszeitung, Tuesday 28 January 2008</b>
</p><p>
&#8216;...At the centre [of the performance] is the Leipzig Gewandhaus 
Orchestra, with Christopher Hogwood at the helm. He is not the first 
&#8216;period-performance&#8217; maestro to have occupied the rostrum with them, but
 he is the first who has proved on the other side of the Augustusplatz 
that Leipzig&#8217;s showcase orchestra can satisfy the demands of period 
performance. The orchestral texture was vivid, bright, lively and 
transparent. Vibrato was the exception rather than the rule and even 
then it was at the service of emotional expression., as was everything 
else in this stern, sage opera.'
</p><p>
&#8216;...[the production] was not aiming at bland beauty of sound, but 
at substance and content. Hogwood nurtures both. The players react 
sensitively, delicately and with such a secure sense of style that one 
would have thought they had never played in any other way.'
</p><p>
<b>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 31 January 2008</b>
</p><p>
&#8216;...Somewhere in the middle of the overture, which already  provides
 a clear indication of the verve, attention to detail and transparency 
which Hogwood has achieved with the Gewandhaus Orchestra, a cin&#233; 
projection of one of the &#8216;rooms&#8217; provides us with the opportunity 
actually to observe from above how a young woman casts her garment aside
 and dives into a pool. . .&#8217;
</p><p>
<b>S&#228;chsiche Zeitung, 29 January 2008</b>
</p><p>
&#8216;...In conductor Christopher Hogwood, Mozart has an expert, precise 
and skilled interpreter at his disposal . This early-music specialist is
 less well-known for his work in the opera-house, but he conveys very 
precisely the accentuation and the moods, handles the intricate 
structure and development with care and plumbs the depths of the 
richly-nuanced score.'
</p><p>
<b>Leipziger-Almanach, 26 January 2008</b>
</p><p>
'. . .Enthusiasm and applause throughout the ranks. It&#8217;s a long time 
since an opera has been received with such whole-hearted approval in 
Leipzig as Mozart&#8217;s <i>La Clemenza di Tito</i> at the premiere on 25 
January 2008. The enthusiasm was directed above all at the very good 
soloists and their willing collaborators of the Gewandhaus Orchestra 
under Christopher Hogwood. This outstanding conductor knew exactly how 
to blend insight and  attention to detail in presenting Mozart&#8217;s music 
in all its formal perfection and clarity of expression. Thanks to his 
balanced but  never excessively purist approach to historically-informed
 performance the music flowed onward with a grace and elegance that was 
nimble, light in texture and in the best sense &#8216;well-tempered&#8217;. This 
alone was without any doubt enough in itself to make the occasion a 
highlight of the opera season.'</p>
