If you missed it, it is still not too late for you to hear Christopher talk on Radio 4, for the programme <i>Random Edition</i>, about Handel's <i>Musick for the Royal Fireworks</i>.
 The series, presented by John Snow, examines stories provided by
archive newspapers. This particular programme, broadcast on 2 January
2008, takes the story in a Penny London Post newspaper from 1749 and
examines the various elements of the great event that was the Royal
Fireworks in London's Green Park - from music to location, and
technicalities to politics.
