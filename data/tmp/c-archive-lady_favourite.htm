Ahead of his Royal Opera House run of Purcell's <i>Dido and Aeneas</i> and Handel's <i>Acis and Galatea</i> &#8212; a double-bill of anniversary-year
composers that also pairs The Royal Opera with The Royal Ballet &#8212; this week's edition of <i>The Lady</i> features an interview with Christopher in its
column 'Favourite Things'. 

</p><p>
While also making room for some of his <i>least</i> favourite things &#8211; 
background music and needlessly 'updated' opera productions &#8211; the 
article takes in Christopher's diverse tastes as a musician ('far beyond
 the baroque') and as a collector: 30,000 books; 3,000 coffee cans.
</p><p>
The article (by David Gillard, from <i>The Lady</i>, March 17-23) 
appears below. Apologies, on behalf of the publication, to Christopher&#8217;s
 donkey Rabanne, mother of Paco, for the misspelling of her name.
