    <p>
This year Christopher discovers the true international nature of Haydn, with invitations to conduct the <i>Nelson Mass</i> in Krakow, the
<i>Paukenmesse</i> with the Munich Philharmonic and <i>The Creation</i> with the Residentie Orchestra in The Hague&#8230;

</p><p>
<img src="upload/haydn1.jpg" alt="haydn1.jpg" class="imgleft" height="480" width="380">In
 addition, a roll-call of symphonies for this year finds No. 13 in Bonn,
 No. 43  in Vienna&#8216;s Musikverein,  No. 70 in Cambridge and London, plus 
the more familiar No.100 as part of the Mecklenburg Festival and No.104 
in Tokyo, Turin and Krakow.
</p><p>
Of the concertos that for cello (C major) is heard in Frankfurt and 
Mecklenburg, the D major keyboard concerto (on a forte-piano, moreover) 
in Vienna, the trumpet concerto in Bonn and the cheerful Sinfonia 
Concertante in Stuttgart.
</p><p>
Amongst publications, the <i>Petite Pi&#232;ces</i> for keyboard are already 
in print with HH Edition; Paul Wranitzky&#8216;s intriguing arrangements of 
three Haydn string quartets expanded with winds to form nonets have just
 appeared (see News item above) and later in the year the three piano 
sonatas Op. 22 by John Cramer, which are dedicated to Haydn will be 
published. B&#228;renreiter are meanwhile issuing revised versions of some of
 Christopher&#8217;s editions of the excellent Salomon arrangements of the 
London symphonies adapted for &#8220;quintetto&#8221;.
</p><p>
All this, plus invitations to speak at the Cheltenham and Hay-on-Wye 
Book Festivals (a new departure for Christopher) &#8211; a very creditable 
itinerary for Papa Haydn.</p>
