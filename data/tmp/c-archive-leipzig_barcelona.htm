Not a great deal to report from October&#8217;s gastronomic travels; Leipzig&#8217;s
 gentle pace of life means plenty of the expected small caf&#233;s and 
bier-kellers well frequented at all hours of day (and some at night, 
though it is not a great town for late opening). Near to the Gewandhaus 
concert-hall (in fact in front of the front door) is the Augustus 
Restaurant:

with friendly meals of all sizes, nice wines and great windows on all 
sides for people-watching and open after concerts till late. At the top 
of the radio building close by (29th floor) is the Panorama restaurant

excellent day-time food and wine, no music worth worrying about and a 
view over a very flat city with many cranes at work trying to redeem its
 post-war architecture. Of the old city of Bach, Schumann and 
Mendelssohn there is less culinary evidence, but the

looks right, even if the service is cursory and the Auerbach Keller (now
 in the main pedestrian drag) needs a visit if only for the memories of 
Goethe&#8217;s <i>Faust</i>, which opens there (and was partly written there according to my waitress).

Barcelona, usually a great dining experience, was rather spoilt by an 
excess of loud music or heavy cigarette smoke (sometimes both) in most 
eating places (the famous &#8220;4 Cats&#8221; was specially obnoxious). For 
music-free dining there is:
</p><p>
El Pintor restaurant<br>
Sant Honorat, 7<br>

For a slightly busier and noisier atmosphere (rather like a very high 
class canteen but with excellent design and typography) is:
</p><p>
La Dolca Herminia<br>
Magdalenes 27<br>
08002 Barcelona<br>
Tel. 93 317 06 76
</p><p>
no reservations, but the queue moves quite quickly. Josep Pons 
introduced me to a fine Japanese restaurant a little further north in 
the city:

And on matters of drink and music, I came across the following revelation in the BBC&#8217;s November <i>Music Magazine</i>:
</p><p>
<b>A Grape Performance</b><br>
<i>Carlo Cignozzi, a Tuscan vineyard owner, has found that playing 
Mozart in his fields is having a beneficial effect on his Sangiovese 
grapes. Since he started spraying his crop with quavers and crotchets 
four years ago, Cignozzi has found that parasites and bacteria have been
 resisted and the grapes have matured early. Italian academics now want 
to research whether the link is pure coincidence or has some scientific 
basis. If so, they may want to get in touch with scientists at the 
University of Pavia who have shown that listening to music can also help
 to reduce stress-related heart problems... especially in those who are 
themselves musically trained. According to the researchers, the 
physiological effects of music, such as slowing the heart rate, have 
been shown to be greater in those who have learned an instrument than 
they are in non-musicians. So, get learning!</i></p>
