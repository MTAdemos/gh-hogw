Christopher resumes his duties as Gresham Professor of Music with the 
start of a new series of lectures entitled 'The Making of a 
Masterpiece', in which he examines a number of acknowledged 
masterpieces, but each from a select angle only - their scoring, 
compactness, virtuosity, accessibility, memorability or other flavour.  
After each lecture, Gresham College is making available videos and 
podcasts of its Professors' offerings. Click on the links below to be 
taken to Gresham College's media downloads for each lecture.

The art of being succinct is not one always associated with the works of
 Bach; in his compact setting of the Magnificat he employs economy and 
symbolism to illuminate each verse in a few minutes of music which 
challenges the listener to &#8220;de-code&#8221; the full message.

<a href="http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/the-joy-of-six">2) The Joy of Six</a><br>
The choice of instrumental grouping can make or break a composition; the
 string sextet, a notoriously difficult combination, takes on a 
forward-looking guise with Strauss in probably the most exquisite of all
 music designed to be played off-stage, while Brahms looks back to the 
baroque with his solutions: sonority is the key.

<a href="http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/remember-me">3) Remember Me</a><br>
Memorability is sometimes achieved by the simple technique of 
repetition, in addition to more high-flown inspiration. Some of the 
simplest sustaining devices of great music are ground bass, ostinato or 
chaconne; this lecture shows that a canon can be more than simply "Three
 Blind Mice".

<i>Mozart's Oboe Quartet in F major K.370<br>
With Mea Wade and players from the Royal Academy of Music</i><br>
Harnessing virtuosity to good taste and fireworks to fine craftsmanship 
is a permanent challenge for the composer. Purely technical show will 
have little lasting effect, and Mozart was especially scrupulous at 
linking what sounded effective with what was musically needed. We 
examine with Mea Wade the requirements of good oboe playing and some of 
that instrument's special qualities, and hear a performance of the 
quartet with players from the Royal Academy of Music.  The quartet 
comprises Eleanor Corr (violin), Richard Waters (viola) and Antonio 
Novais (cello).

<a href="http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/the-opening-salvo">5) The Opening Salvo</a><br>
<i>Beethoven's String Quartet in F major Op.18 No.1<br>
With the Wilhelm Quartet</i><br>
How to be revolutionary without scaring away your public? How to 
announce yourself as a new broom without alienating the more stalwart 
connoisseurs? Beethoven faced these problems when presenting his first 
six string quartets for publication as opus 18; did he win his public 
and allay their fears with his choice of opening?  The Wilhelm Quartet 
comprises Marciana Buta (violin), Charlotte Skinner (violin), Daisy 
Spiers (viola) and Hetty Snell (cello).
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/the-challenge-of-the-solo">5) The Challenge of the Solo</a><br>
Pavlo Beznosiuk, one of the world's leading baroque violinists, explains
 and demonstrates the challenge of music for solo violin; works by 
Nicola Matteis and Heinrich Biber lead to a discussion and performance 
of the famous Chaconne from Bach's Solo Partita in D minor. Can such a 
work be satisfactorily analysed or does "music begin where words leave 
off"?</p>
