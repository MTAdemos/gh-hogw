 composer V&#225;clav Pichl (1741&#8211;1805) spent much of his working life in 
Vienna, where the Empress Maria Theresa preferred him to Mozart. His 
compositions were performed at Eszterhaza by Haydn, who had a set of 
Pichl's "new quartets" copied in 1780 (he wrote over 30 quartets in 
all). 

</p><p>
Op. 13, the present set of stylish and skilfully contrasted works, were 
dedicated to Dittersdorf, one of his early employers. They exploit all 
four instruments equally (even the viola is allocated elaborate solo 
passages) and offer an attractive alternative to the standard Viennese 
works of this period.</p>
