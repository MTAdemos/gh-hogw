We
were delighted to learn that Emma Kirkby has finally been created a
Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen's
Birthday Honours list. Writing on her website Emma says: &#8220;My greatest
pleasure has always been to work collaboratively, drawing inspiration
from musicologists, directors and colleagues both vocal and
instrumental. I am deeply grateful for this honour, which I see as a
celebration of the powers of ensemble, clarity and stillness, beyond
those of volume and display.&#8221;

Christopher was interviewed earlier this month about his work with Emma
Kirkby over the years for an edition of the 'South Bank Show' on ITV1.
Emma was filmed undertaking a wide variety of engagements; from coaching
 skilled amateur singers in Monteverdi madrigals in Udine, Italy &#8211; to
performing Bach cantatas with the Purcell quartet, and Hildegard
sequences in the beautiful setting of St. Bartholomew&#8217;s Church
Smithfield, London. The programme is scheduled for Sunday 22 July.
