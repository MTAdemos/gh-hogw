The recently released fourth and final installment in 
Christopher&#8217;s recordings of the complete violin and viola concertos with
 Bohuslav Matou&#353;ek and the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra (Hyperion 
Records) has been welcomed enthusiastically by Gramophone magazine 
(&#8220;strongly recommended&#8221; &#8212; see below for full review) and has just been 
nominated as a Disc of the Month by Classics Today:

 release is desirable not only for Bohuslav Matou&#353;ek&#8217;s total 
identification with Martin&#367;&#8217;s idiom - his rhythmic confidence, technical
 security (especially in high positions), and a lyrical sweetness that 
never turns cloying (in both slow movements) - but also for the crisp, 
snappy playing of the Czech Philharmonic under Christopher Hogwood, 
arguably today&#8217;s preeminent Martin&#367; conductor (how about a symphony 
cycle, Hyperion?).'

Soon to be published is Christopher&#8217;s new edition of the complete ballet
 music for La Revue de Cuisine, which has previously only been available
 in the form of an extracted suite (Leduc, Paris), and he is currently 
working on a new edition of the Sinfonia Concertante, for violin, cello,
 oboe, bassoon and small orchestra as one of the first issues of the new
 <a href="http://www.martinu.cz/english/t_page.php?pid=396">Bohuslav Martin&#367; Complete Edition</a>
</p><p>
Throughout the year, Martin&#367; will feature in Christopher&#8217;s concert 
programming, beginning with the Metropolitan Orchestra, Lisbon, and 
followed by Stuttgart Radio SO and the Britten Sinfonia. He continues 
his work with the Martin&#367; Foundation in Prague which is committed to 
producing a complete Urtext edition of the composer&#8217;s works, and 
highlighting his music in a series of festivals and conferences 
throughout the world during this 50th anniversary of his death.
</p><p>
News of the other anniversaries of 2009 and Christopher&#8217;s involvement in
 them will come in the next month's web News; expect plenty of 
Mendelssohn, Haydn, Handel and Purcell.</p>

The final set in Hyperion's Martin&#367; survey brings us more excellent playing.
</p><p>
Martin&#367;'s two violin concertos have very different histories. The First 
was created for Dushkin in 1931, much tinkered with over the next few 
years and then "lost" until Halbreich unearthed it in 1968. The Second 
(1943) was written in just two months for Mischa Elman, premiered before
 the year was out and taken up by several violinists soon afterwards, 
often being programmed unnumbered until its predecessor came to light.
</p><p>
Josef Suk set the benchmark for both but his recordings, still in the 
Supraphon catalogue, have been overtaken by this newcomer and, in No 2, 
by Isabelle Faust's superb recent account (Harmonia Mundi, 8/08). 
Matou&#353;ek and Hogwood certainly have the measure of both scores and in 
the Second run Faust and Belohlavek close. I do like the latter's 
expansive approach in the central Andante moderato where Matou&#353;ek and 
Hogwood are two minutes swifter (and Suk and Neumann faster still) but I
 really cannot choose between them. Couplings may prove decisive, not 
least the best available Toccata e Due Canzone (Faust) or the Viola 
Rhapsody-Concerto (Suk); my recommendation is for the Hyperion set as a 
whole (Vol 3 includes the Rhapsody-Concerto) but I would not want to be 
without the Harmonia Mundi. Concerto No 1 was formerly available on 
Supraphon with the Suite Concertante's second version included on Vol 3 
(7/08), although the published recording dates of the Suite suggested 
otherwise (Hyperion says it is correcting this on future issues). 
Strongly recommended.

The only serious competition for this disc, the final installment in 
Hyperion&#8217;s splendid four-volume survey of Martin&#367;&#8217;s complete music for 
solo violin and orchestra, comes from Josef Suk&#8217;s classic Supraphon 
versions with this same orchestra under Vaclav Neumann. There is very 
little to choose between them, as both are excellent, but collectors may
 well want to hear these pieces in finely balanced digital sound. 
Jennifer Koh&#8217;s recording of the Second Concerto on Cedille, coupled to 
works by Szymanowski and Bart&#243;k, is also first-rate and worth 
consideration.

This release is desirable not only for Bohuslav Matou&#353;ek&#8217;s total 
identification with Martin&#367;&#8217;s idiom&#8212;his rhythmic confidence, technical 
security (especially in high positions), and a lyrical sweetness that 
never turns cloying (in both slow movements)&#8212;but also for the crisp, 
snappy playing of the Czech Philharmonic under Christopher Hogwood, 
arguably today&#8217;s preeminent Martin&#367; conductor (how about a symphony 
cycle, Hyperion?). These two works aren&#8217;t just two of the 20th century&#8217;s
 best violin concertos; they also offer a perfect synopsis of the 
composer&#8217;s mature style.
</p><p>
The First Concerto is a brash, spiky piece in Martin&#367;&#8217;s &#8220;concerto 
grosso&#8221; mode, pitting the violin against small instrumental 
groups&#8212;including percussion&#8212;in every imaginable combination with 
unflagging rhythmic verve. The Second Concerto, written in the U.S. for 
Misha Elman, adopts a more lyrical idiom, with plenty of &#8220;golden age&#8221; 
Romantic virtuosity built in as well. Both are essential, as is this 
whole series. What a pleasure it is to see labels taking on and 
completing interesting, rewarding, and ambitious projects like this with
 such distinction. Bravo!</p>
