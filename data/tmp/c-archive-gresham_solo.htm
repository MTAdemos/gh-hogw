Pavlo Beznosiuk, one of the world's leading baroque violinists, explains
 and demonstrates the challenge of music for solo violin; works by 
Nicola Matteis and Heinrich Biber lead to a discussion and performance 
of the famous Chaconne from Bach's Solo Partita in D minor. Can such a 
work be satisfactorily analysed or does "music begin where words leave 
off"?  You can watch or listen to the lecture by

This is the final lecture in Christopher's 2011&#8211;12 series, <i>The Making of a Masterpiece</i>,
 in which he examines a number of acknowledged masterpieces, but each 
from a select angle only - their scoring, compactness, virtuosity, 
accessibility, memorability or other flavour.  <a href="http://www.hogwood.org/admin/index.php?page_id=256">
