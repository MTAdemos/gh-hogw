 This is Christopher's first year of appearing at literature festivals 
and he is pleased to have been invited to be a guest at the longest 
running festival of its kind - The Times Cheltenham Literature Festival.
 He attended on the last day of the festival and spent a very enjoyable 
afternoon in a question and answer session, fronted by Christopher Cook,
 responding to excellent questions from both Cook and the public. A book
 signing followed at which many books were proffered. Christopher is 
very much enjoying his new literary career and looks forward to many 
other opportunities to attend such festivals.
