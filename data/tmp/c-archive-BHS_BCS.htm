collection.

    <p>
Members of the BCS and the BHS arrived at Christopher's Cambridge house 
on 31 October 2009 to spend the afternoon viewing Christopher's personal
 collection of 16 clavichords and harpsichords. All the instruments had 
been tuned the day before (quite an achievement) to ensure that they 
were in optimum condition for the viewers, and the tuners and restorers 
of the antique instruments were on hand on the day to provide valuable 
background information.<br>

Micaela Schmitz of the BHS wrote an account of the day for the BHS website. The full article is below.
