The review continues:
</p><p>
"For this recording Christopher Hogwood uses a performance edition that 
takes into account manuscript sources that pre-date Walsh's compilation.
 It is good to have the Handel and Haydn Society's disciplined and lean 
performances available again thanks to this newly compiled and 
remastered reissue. The opening of Op 3 No 2 has deliciously sprung 
rhythms and fine solo concertino playing; the sublime cello duet in the 
following Largo is sinewy yet tender, its melancholic mood enhanced by 
the restrained oboe solo. Handel later added oboes and bassoons to some 
of the Op 6 concertos when they were performed in the theatre but 
Hogwood prefers Handel's original scoring for string orchestra 
throughout. 
</p><p>
The Handel and Haydn Society's alert enthusiasm is tangible throughout 
these polished and stylish readings, originally recorded by 
L'Oiseau-Lyre. Hogwood directs with natural sensitivity and his 
tastefully emphasised suspensions and relaxed shaping of cadences are 
consistently perfect."</p>
