Christopher
 conducted two concerts with a programme of pieces by each of the year's
 five major anniversary composers: Purcell, Handel, Haydn, Mendelssohn 
and Martin&#367;. Reviews appeared in <i>The Sunday Times</i> and <i>Seen and Heard International</i>.

&#8220;At Queen Elizabeth Hall, the Britten Sinfonia, playing a work by each 
of the year&#8217;s five main anniversary composers, was conducted by 
Christopher Hogwood, hardly a young thing, though still 
youthful-seeming, and indelibly associated, for me at least, with that 
marvellous educational programme he presented on Radio 3 throughout the 
1970s, The Young Idea. When he spoke about the items &#8212; telling us that 
they were not thematically linked, but offered a journey through period 
interpretation from the baroque style of Purcell and Handel to the 
classicism of Haydn, Mendelssohn&#8217;s romanticism and the 20th-century 
neoclassicism of Martinu &#8212; well, it was just like another 
thought-provoking episode of The Young Idea. This was Hogwood's first 
appearance with [The Britten Sinfonia], and the relationship is clearly 
productive. The six bright minutes of Purcell's Fairy Queen overture, 
followed by Handel's Concerto Grosso in F, Op 3, No 4, encapsulated his 
gifts as a baroque specialist, and valveless brass and olden timpani 
were retained not only for Haydn's Symphony No 70, but also for 
Mendelssohn's Fair Melusina Overture, giving the latter a surprising and
 fabulous crackling edge. For Martinu's Sinfonia Concertante, using four
 soloists from the orchestra, Handel's harpsichord continuo was replaced
 by a grand piano, and the music bristled with life.&#8221;

&#8220;Major to minor key shifts and tricky fugal themes fill [Haydn's 
Symphony No. 70], giving the Britten Sinfonia the chance to show what a 
versatile and talented group of players they are. The delicate unpeeling
 of the second movement&#8217;s complex canonic structure was particularly 
impressive.&#8221; (John-Pierre Joyce, <a href="http://www.musicweb-international.com/SandH/2009/Jul-Dec09/Britten_Sinfonia_2610.html"><i>Seen and Heard International</i></a>)</p>
