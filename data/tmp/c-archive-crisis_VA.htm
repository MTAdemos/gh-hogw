<img src="upload/images.jpg" alt="images.jpg" class="imgleft" height="80" width="124">There
 has been widespread consternation in the music world at the news that 
the the V&amp;A plans to break up the collection that has been fostered 
since they bought their first instrument in 1856. A petition to the 
Prime Minister has been written and signed by many, including 
Christopher. The museum has issued a statement saying that the 
instruments are being moved to make way for more fashion on the basis 
that they are a museum for the decorative arts, and fashion is more 
fitting for that description. Read Ben Hoyle's article in <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article7010483.ece">The Times</a> 
for more information.

Christopher, who holds a personal affection for both the venue and its 
instruments, having played concerts and recorded CDs on the instruments 
there, believes it is important not to break up such a collection. His 
worry is that, as a result of the loss of official space in which to 
display the instruments, they will find themselves kept out of sight, 
under lock and key. These instruments, whilst being appreciable for an 
aesthetic value, are also of great importance to those academics, like 
Christopher, who want to revive the sound as well as view the sight of 
these important instruments.

The fate of the instrument gallery is still under discussion. You can <a href="http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/VandAchange/">sign the petition</a>, or take action in person, to which end Judith
Wardman of the British Clavichord Society advises members:

</p><p style="padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px;">
'<b>Last chance to visit to the Musical Instrument Gallery and express your concern:</b><br>

</p><p style="padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px;">
'Forgive me if you've already heard that there's a chance to demonstrate
 your concern about the V&amp;A proposal this Thursday lunch-time, <b>4 February, 1 to 2pm</b>.
 Meet at the entrance to the instrument gallery, where James Yorke of 
the V&amp;A will be opening the gallery to the public for what seems to 
be the last time. Various organizers are suggesting that as many people 
as possible should turn up to protest at the closure and to pressure the
 museum to make the best possible arrangements for its instruments in 
the future.'</p>
