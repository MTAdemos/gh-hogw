Dorottya Fabian&#8217;s new book, <i>Bach Performance Practice</i>, 1945&#8211;1975 
(Ashgate, 2003) contains a quotation from an interview which Christopher
 gave to Gerhard Persch&#233; in 1984, translated by John Kehoe.
</p><p>
To provide the full context for that quotation, here is the full text of
 the interview, provided by Dorottya Fabian and reproduced with the 
permission of <i>Opernwelt</i>:
</p><p>
 <b>Authenticity is not academic</b> <i>a conversation from 1984 with Christopher Hogwood, the guiding spirit of The Academy of Ancient Music.</i>
</p><p>
<b>Opernwelt</b>: Mr Hogwood, &#8216;early&#8217; music in &#8216;authentic sound&#8217; &#8212; is 
that in fact as Neville Marriner once formulated it, &#8216;very popular with 
the open-toed-sandals- and-brown-bread-set&#8217;, a &#8216;macro-biotic&#8217; movement, 
so to speak, in the music scene?
</p><p>
<b>Hogwood</b>: I know Neville Marriner well enough from our years of 
working together to take what he says in jest. But there is indeed a 
kernel of truth in it, or rather, there used to be, when I think of the 
boom that dominated the mid-sixties in the area of mediaeval music. That
 was &#8216;in&#8217; at the time, from every respectable record came the sound of 
crumhorns, Rauschpfeifen and all that kind of thing. It was an entirely 
new &#8216;old&#8217; sound, but not a soul knew if it was authentic or not.
</p><p>
<b>Opernwelt</b>: You yourself took part, as a member of David Munrow&#8217;s &#8216;Early Music Consort&#8217;...
</p><p>
<b>Hogwood</b>: Naturally, it was at that time a wholly new world for 
all of us, and good for the public too, since it became acquainted with a
 new repertoire. There was a lot of showbiz attached to it. Finally my 
interest in this kind of music became exhausted, because we did not know
 whether or not what we were doing was authentic. Although the whole 
world thought that this type of music-making had a musicological 
foundation, the very opposite was the case: we had to do a lot on 
&#8216;feeling&#8217;, because there was insufficient basis and definite proof of 
the way in which music was made in the middle ages. In looking for an 
&#8216;original sound&#8217;, we were very much dependent upon hypotheses.
</p><p>
<b>Opernwelt</b>: Didn&#8217;t that discourage you?
</p><p>
<b>Hogwood</b>: No, not at all, on the contrary. I turned to an area, to
 a period, which offered me reliable sources. That was the music of the 
17th and 18th centuries.
</p><p>
<b>Opernwelt</b>: In the eyes of many people, the attempts to 
reconstruct the original sound, etc, have something about them, of the 
supposedly dusty atmosphere of musicological institutes, of archives.
</p><p>
<b>Hogwood</b>: In the eyes of many people there exists a gulf between 
boring musicology, which is done by old men in archives, and 
music-making, practical musical education, for example the violinists 
playing Wieniawski in the conservatories. Men such as Raymond Leppard, 
whom I met while studying at Cambridge, and who is at home in both 
areas, achieving great things, always tried to bridge the gap. Through 
them I came by this kind of music.
</p><p>
<b>Opernwelt</b>: Was your career as a musician pre-determined, by your parents perhaps?
</p><p>
<b>Hogwood</b>: No, not at all. My parents were active in quite 
different professions. But there was music-making at home, and I had 
some piano lessons, but without much success.
</p><p>
I don&#8217;t know how it came about &#8212; perhaps I heard a record of Wanda 
Landowska &#8212; suddenly I became in any case enormously interested in the 
harpsichord, if only still as a hobby. At Cambridge I studied Latin and 
Greek at first, and philosophy, I wanted to go in for an archaeological 
career.
</p><p>
At all events, I met musicians like David Munrow, David Atherton and so 
on, and the meeting with Raymond Leppard was one of the deciding factors
 in switching to a music course. At first I specialised very much in 
baroque music, together with David Munrow, but on modern instruments. 
Then I went for a year to Prague, to rummage through the archives, and 
when I came back from there my interest in baroque music had lessened, I
 had somehow come up against a barrier, the barrier of what one can do 
in this area on modern instruments. At the same time, David Munrow had 
gone the same way, and so we plunged into what was then for us the so 
exotic, if still hypothetical, sound world of mediaeval music. I played 
with the Early Music Consort for ten years. Alongside that I also began 
playing with Neville Marriner and his Academy of 
St-Martin-in-the-Fields, giving solo harpsichord recitals and writing a 
lot about music.
</p><p>
For the reasons I have already given, my interest in mediaeval music 
became exhausted; the repertoire that I played with &#8216;St Martins&#8217; aroused
 my attention more and more, together with the desire for an &#8216;authentic 
sound&#8217;, which I had preserved from my involvement with mediaeval music. I
 tried increasingly to give my solo recitals on historical instruments, 
too, because the harpsichords built in modern times had a sound that one
 could only place in the realm of the imagination or, better, of toys.
</p><p>
<b>Opernwelt</b>: How did &#8216;The Academy of Ancient Music&#8217; come into being?
</p><p>
<b>Hogwood</b>: I looked about me in England. There were many small 
groups who played, for example, chamber music of the renaissance, and so
 on. Together with Decca we gave birth to the plan to found a small 
orchestra to play the music of the 18th century, made up of about 25 
players. That&#8217;s how the first group of the &#8216;Academy&#8217; came into being ten
 years ago.
</p><p>
That such a project was possible we saw from the example of Nikolaus 
Harnoncourt, whom we had not then heard in person, but whose records we 
knew.
</p><p>
We really met together for the first time in the recording studio, at 
the first session. But we very quickly found our style, because most of 
the people had the same background and approached the material in the 
same way. Much about our style is not principally my invention, but has 
developed from the similarity of approach, democratically, as a 
synthesis of views and information.
</p><p>
The group has got bigger and bigger, we started with an early baroque 
repertoire and worked forward chronologically, historically speaking. At
 the same time our style has always remained open and flexible, because I
 can see with other groups the danger of too fixed a style, which one 
uses for each and every thing. Then one is really in the same situation 
as a modern symphony orchestra which also plays Johann Sebastian Bach 
with a Richard Strauss sound.
</p><p>
<b>Opernwelt</b>: In a press release from your record company it says 
that your Academy of Ancient Music is in no way an English follower of 
continental efforts such as the Concentus Musicus of Nikolaus 
Harnoncourt, but that you saw as the focal point of your work the 
revival primarily of English music of the 17th and 18th centuries, 
including the early classical period. But now you have just been 
arousing attention with your recording of the complete Mozart symphonies
 in an attempt at an authentic sound. So a British Harnoncourt after 
all?
</p><p>
<b>Hogwood</b>: No. Naturally we turned at first to the English 
repertoire of the period which we had chosen, but in the course of time,
 and with our successes, other things were asked of us: Vivaldi, Bach 
and sons, later Stamitz, Haydn etc. And then, when at Decca, they were 
discussing a new recording of the Mozart symphonies and at the same time
 the choice between the accustomed &#8216;romantic&#8217; sound picture of the 
Vienna Philharmonic or our attempts at a particular authentic one, they 
chose us. To my astonishment, I have to say, Decca bore the risk.
</p><p>
Happily we also had Neal Zaslaw, who, through his researches, gave us a 
plan, according to which we could approach the 64 symphonies of Mozart, 
geographically and stylistically &#8212; Salzburg, Paris, Italian symphonies, 
various sizes of orchestra, various combinations of instruments. From 
that starting point we were able to come to grips with the project, 
because we also had in mind that Mozart always tailored his symphonies 
to the strengths and weaknesses of the particular orchestra.
</p><p>
But to come back to your &#8216;British Harnoncourt&#8217;. I am certainly not that,
 neither am I the &#8216;Karajan of Early Music&#8217;, as an American magazine 
called me. I believe that our English way of playing is very different 
from the continental. It is, might I say, more democratic, our style 
develops, as I have already tried to explain, more on the level of 
common agreement, not on that in which one person sets the style.
</p><p>
English musicians appear to me, too, on account of this democratic 
practice, more flexible when it comes to accommodating to various 
styles. That has probably to do with the fact that our people, who all 
come from a London early music &#8216;pool&#8217;, play with constantly changing 
groupings, and not always in the same orchestra. And finally it seems to
 be of the essence that our musicians come from a tradition very 
different from the continental. The continental &#8216;early&#8217; musician has 
mostly started out with a so-called &#8216;modern&#8217; instrument, the strings for
 example in one of the big orchestras with a &#8216;romantic&#8217; performance 
practice, and then taken a step backwards. With us it is mostly the 
other way round, many started out with the viol and then made the 
adjustment forwards.
</p><p>
<b>Opernwelt</b>: Nevertheless you still have stylistic preferences. Recently, in fact, your &#8216;Academy of Ancient Music&#8217; has split.
</p><p>
<b>Hogwood</b>: Yes. One group concentrates more on the baroque 
repertoire, and is made up primarily of musicians who want to work 
further on baroque music on baroque instruments. The other group is 
broadening its repertoire into the classical period &#8212; Beethoven&#8217;s first 
symphony has been recorded, later we shall certainly go on to Rossini, 
Mendelssohn etc. I made this division, too, in order to maintain the 
vitality and freshness of the ensemble. The groups overlap by about 
sixty, seventy percent in terms of personnel, nevertheless.
</p><p>
<b>Opernwelt</b>: Wanda Landowska, whom you mentioned earlier, once said
 to a colleague who thought that Bach would certainly have composed for a
 modern piano had he known one: &#8216;You play Bach your play, I&#8217;ll play him 
mine&#8217;.
</p><p>
<b>Hogwood</b>: Certainly Bach would have liked a Steinway piano, he was
 open to everything new, but he would have composed differently. He is 
around today &#8212; he is called Brubeck.
</p><p>
I think the often-stated opinion, that composers of the past would have 
breathed a sigh of relief had they known &#8216;modern&#8217; instruments, is 
absolute nonsense. To begin with, because the assertion that present-day
 instruments are better, cannot be upheld. Today&#8217;s instruments may be 
more perfect &#8212; I would not even subscribe to that in all cases &#8212; they 
are, as far as the strings are concerned, louder, but on the other hand,
 their palette of colours and nuances is reduced.
</p><p>
<b>Opernwelt</b>: Do you think that composers of earlier times were always content with the conditions they were offered?
</p><p>
<b>Hogwood</b>: At any event they adapted themselves to the means placed
 at their disposal. Mozart might have liked the number of strings that 
were available to him in Mannheim or Paris. But you cannot go with this 
argument and say: give him the same, larger number for all of his 
symphonies. Because Mozart waited until he arrived in the particular 
town, heard the singers in the theatre, heard the orchestra, and then 
composed &#8216;bespoke&#8217;. His genius was just that, to adjust his art to the 
given conditions. There is no reason, by changing the conditions, to 
&#8216;improve&#8217; him any more than there is reason to freshen up Leonardo&#8217;'s 
paintings by over-painting with acrylic paints.
</p><p>
<b>Opernwelt</b>: But Beethoven&#8217;s problems with orchestral personnel are quite evident...
</p><p>
<b>Hogwood</b>: This is wrongly interpreted too. When we just recorded 
his first symphony, we knew from contemporary reports that it sounded 
like a concerto for woodwinds. We were guided by that in the size of our
 orchestra. For his seventh symphony he brought three orchestras 
together, obviously it contains something special that requires size. 
Mozart was absolutely happy with the seven first and seven second 
violins in the &#8216;Jupiter&#8217; symphony, with four firsts and three seconds in
 the &#8216;Prague&#8217;, but also with fourteen firsts and ten seconds in the 
&#8216;Paris&#8217;. We shouldn&#8217;t we follow that guidance?
</p><p>
One other aspect should not be ignored in all these considerations: that
 of the space in which the particular works sounded. The wrong space can
 give you a totally false aural impression. And there is another point: 
we have &#8216;wrong&#8217; ears too.
</p><p>
<b>Opernwelt</b>: Is it possible to go over the history of a work&#8217;s 
reception when it is reproduced? Is it possible today still to play a 
Mozart string quartet, as if Bartok had never been?
</p><p>
<b>Hogwood</b>: What I said about &#8216;wrong&#8217; ears was not meant totally 
negatively. We are more open today: in Mozart&#8217;s times there was only one
 style, which was accepted, today one can hear Mozart and Bartok 
alongside one another. That has advantages: somebody who as a string 
player has played Penderecki will have more variety of command over his 
instrument. I have in the Academy musicians who play jazz on the side, 
and greatly welcome that.
</p><p>
To take the history of a work&#8217;s reception into account in performance is
 not wrong. There is of course no moral sanction for the interpretation 
of a work. Many people choose this kind of interpretation, I choose 
another. The attempt to restore an authentic sound picture gives me a 
scheme, a framework, a channel into which I can guide my feelings, but 
there is always quite enough room for wholly personal interpretation. 
There can be no question of academic coldness, as many people maintain, 
in authentic playing.
</p><p>
<b>Opernwelt</b>: So you are not the conductor as Stravinsky requires him, a bell ringer who simply pulls the rope?
</p><p>
<b>Hogwood</b> Stravinsky&#8217;s ideal does not exist, that doesn&#8217;t work at 
all. But I do not regard myself as a dictator, a leader of an army of 
musical soldiers, but as primus inter pares whose job it is, above all, 
to keep the right balance.
</p><p>
<b>Opernwelt</b>: Is that the case also when you &#8212; more and more &#8212; 
conduct not your own orchestra but &#8216;foreign&#8217; groups? With such as try to
 pour &#8216;Tchaikovsky sauce&#8217; over Mozart and Bach?
</p><p>
<b>Hogwood</b>: Most orchestras, above all in the USA where I make most 
of my guest appearances, are increasingly aware of the various styles. 
The business of &#8216;Tchaikovsky sauce&#8217;, as you put it, doesn&#8217;t hold true 
any more. What I am trying to do is to communicate certain perceptions. 
Such as, that in the 18th century the up-bow in string playing was 
weaker than the down-bow; something that was taken absolutely into 
account by the composers; such as, that in playing keyboard instruments,
 one took into account the fact that the fourth finger was weaker.
</p><p>
Or with respect to interpretation; that the slow second movements in 
Mozart symphonies were by no means the melodramatic expression of a 
philosophy of life, as people have liked to interpret them since the 
Romantic period, but were played really flowingly, while a great deal of
 tension and personality was invested in the minuets and trios.
</p><p>
And I try to convey problems of balance. That in Beethoven&#8217;s piano 
concertos, for instance, the solo instrument, if you think of the 
fortepiano of the day, often had an accompanying function, which perhaps
 does not suit the temperament of a &#8216;modern&#8217; pianist, but which 
nonetheless gives back to the works their authenticity.
</p><p>
<b>Opernwelt</b>: Is authenticity the same as being faithful to the work?
</p><p>
<b>Hogwood</b>: People like to misunderstand the latter concept as 
playing in historical costume. It definitely is not that. My conviction 
is that a work, when it is played &#8216;correctly&#8217; will always remain modern 
in respect of what it says and its effect.
</p><p>
<b>Opernwelt</b>: Does that also go for opera?
</p><p>
<b>Hogwood</b>: As far as this field is concerned, I am a new boy. In my
 student days I played theatre music, even founded my own chamber opera 
company, but have since somewhat neglected this area &#8212; with the 
exception of a &#8216;Don Giovanni&#8217; in St Louis and Handel&#8217;s &#8216;Agrippina&#8217; at La
 Fenice in Venice. That is going to change. Naturally I have my own 
quite definite ideas...
</p><p>
<b>Opernwelt</b>: Influenced by the quest for authenticity?
</p><p>
<b>Hogwood</b>: Certainly. For a start in respect of vocal style. I am 
amazed that stylistically wrong singing is accepted today. I find it 
quite wrong for example, that a Donna Anna sings like a Verdi or Puccini
 prima donna. Dramatic expression to be sure, but Mozart had his own.
</p><p>
<b>Opernwelt</b>: That has certainly to do with a changed idea of drama &#8212; today size of voice and volume play a role.
</p><p>
<b>Hogwood</b>: Concerts and opera are suffering at present from a 
&#8216;Hi-Fi syndrome&#8217;. People aim for the same effects in live performance as
 on record. Brass players, for example, by the most direct way of 
playing, try to give the listener the same impression that is achieved 
in the recording studio by placing a separate microphone in front of 
them. On the other side there are the listening habits of many hi-fi 
freaks who play works at home at such a volume as you never hear live.
</p><p>
But to come back to opera. I have definite ideas there too, relating to 
the stage. To my mind today&#8217;s fashionable &#8216;producers&#8217; theatre&#8217; is of no 
use to 18th century opera. People interpret more into it than is there &#8212;
 a similar problem to the slow movements in Mozart symphonies that I 
mentioned.
</p><p>
I can imagine performances in which &#8212; as used to be the case &#8212; the 
scenery moved around the static singer. Opera singers are mostly not 
especially gifted actors anyway, and it is difficult for them to convey 
the psychological aspects of character &#8212; a modern perspective in any 
case. Part of it is that it is almost impossible adequately to accompany
 somebody who is singing coloratura up-stage. There&#8217;s no contact there. 
There is apparently an unspoken agreement in the world of opera that one
 accepts ragged ensemble. I have never been to an opera performance 
where they were all together. If the same thing happened in a piano 
concerto, it would be very critically noted.
</p><p>
<b>Opernwelt</b>: But wouldn&#8217;t that then be a &#8216;concert in costume&#8217;?
</p><p>
<b>Hogwood</b>: No, by no means. The expression would come from gesture 
and movement. For these performances singers would have to learn a 
special repertoire of gesture, as was customary in the 18th century.
</p><p>
<b>Opernwelt</b>: But this repertoire of rather large gestures rests on 
the fact that the lighting at that time was weaker &#8212; there was simply 
less light.
</p><p>
<b>Hogwood</b>: That is another aspect which could have to be taken into account.
</p><p>
<b>Opernwelt</b>: So fidelity to the work is playing in historical costumes after all.
</p><p>
<b>Hogwood</b>: Again no. I am convinced that here &#8212; as in playing 
concert music on original instruments, under authentic conditions &#8212; 
entirely new perspectives of the works come to light. Of the works, and 
not of individual producers.
</p><p>
<b>Opernwelt</b>: Nevertheless you are going to work at the Deutsche 
Oper, Berlin with Achim Freyer, a producer with a strongly developed 
individual imagination, one who can be placed firmly in the area of 
&#8216;producers&#8217; theatre&#8217;...
</p><p>
<b>Hogwood</b>: Since we are dealing here with a stage version of 
Handel&#8217;s &#8216;Messiah&#8217; for which there is no historical precedent, I don&#8217;t 
have a bad conscience in this connection!
</p><p>
<b>Opernwelt</b>: Mr Hogwood, thank you for talking to us.
