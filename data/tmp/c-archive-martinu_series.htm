<p>
<img src="upload/martinucd.jpg" alt="martinucd.jpg" class="imgright" height="299" width="300">'[Duo
 concertante] Written in Martin&#367;'s best 1930s concerto grosso style, its
 three movements are limpidly scored, allowing the flowing, interweaving
 lines of the soloists to sound to best advantage; as the excellent 
booklet-notes say, "an extraordinary musical experience" &#8230; This disc is 
an utter delight from start to finish.' (Gramophone)</p>

<h3>Volume 2</h3>    
<p>
<img src="upload/martinucd2cover.jpg" alt="martinucd2cover.jpg" class="imgright" height="295" width="300">'Christopher
 Hogwood and Bohuslav Matou&#353;ek are entirely at home with this 
repertoire: there is a wealth of interpretative details, but what 
impresses most is the bigger picture and strong sense of where Martin&#367; 
is going &#8230; In this clear recording there is a huge amount to enjoy.'

<h3>Volume 3</h3>    
<p>
<img src="upload/martinucover3.jpg" alt="martinucover3.jpg" class="imgright" height="300" width="298">'The
 performance of the two-movement Rhapsody-Concerto is exemplary &#8230; 
Matou&#353;ek exchanges violin for viola and luxuriates in the radiant 
lyricism of Martin&#367;'s last period. Hogwood shapes the structures with 
magnificent insight and, with the orchestra, provides attentive 
accompaniment throughout.' (BBC Music Magazine)</p>

</p><h3>Volume 4</h3>       
<p>
<img src="upload/martinu-4.jpg" alt="martinu-4.jpg" class="imgright" height="300" width="300">
'The Second Concerto is one of Martin&#367;'s great masterpieces... In these 
beautifully recorded performances, both Christopher Hogwood and Bohuslav
 Matou&#353;ek have a profound understanding of Martin&#367;'s style and the Czech
 Philharmonic responds with radiant playing &#8230; There is no finer 
performance of the First Concerto available.' (BBC Music Magazine)</p>
