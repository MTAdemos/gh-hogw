Christopher has recently passed a good deal of time in Japan, having 
spent three weeks in September 2009 conducting a concert series of 
predominately Mendelssohn and Beethoven with NHK, and a week in February
 2010 conducting a programme of Handel for the Japan Handel Festival.

When Christopher returned to Japan in February he gave a lecture on 
music editing, at Showa University and conducted a concert in the 
Hamarikyu Asahi Hall. There was a photographer on hand to document the 
occasion and below are pictures of the concert and Christopher relaxing 
with the soloists in between rehearsals:

The concert was reviewed in <a href="http://mdn.mainichi.jp/">The Mainichi Shimbun</a>, a major daily newspaper in Japan. The article has been summarised by the organiser of the festival:
</p><p style="padding-left:24px; padding-right:24px;">
"Handel Festival Japan had a concert of Handel's unusual works conducted
 by Christopher Hogwood, a world famous authority of early music.
His high-toned conducting draws out each peformer's talent.
Japanese period instrumentalists, choir and soloists can achieve great 
success, if they perform with such an excellent conductor.
This concert proved the great advance of early music in Japan."
