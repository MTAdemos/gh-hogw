 Bach on the piano was Stravinsky's "daily bread"; Lillian Libman 
claimed he "began every day of his life by playing two or three fugues 
from the <i>Well-Tempered Clavier</i>", and after the composer's death 
in 1971 Robert Craft reported finding the E-flat minor Prelude from Book
 1 open on the studio piano, the last piece Stravinsky had played three 
days earlier. His copies of the Czerny/Peters edition are now in the 
Paul Sacher Stiftung, Basel, along with the autograph manuscript of his 
arrangements, scored for three clarinets, two bassoons and strings.

In an interview with Craft for the <i>New York Review of Books</i>, he 
said, "As for my 'aim', if I must pretend to have one, I simply wished 
to make the music available in an instrumental form other than the 
keyboard". Although he admitted to including "dynamix" lifted from the 
Czerny edition, he otherwise added very little phrasing and 
articulation, and since every bar exists fully scored in Stravinsky's 
hand, his intentions are rarely unclear. Any dilemmas that required 
editorial solution are explained in the Introduction and referenced in 
the Critical Commentary, and several facsimiles illustrate some of the 
more complex difficulties that had to be resolved.</p>
