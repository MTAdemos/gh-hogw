    Christopher conducts Fabian M&#252;ller's <i>Konzert f&#252;r Orchester</i>.

    <p>
Christopher recently toured Switzerland with his new <i>Urtext</i> edition of the little-known 1834
revision of Mendelssohn's <i>Italian</i> Symphony (the edition, published by <a href="https://www.baerenreiter.com/cgi-bin/baer_V5_my/baerenreiter?op=newuid&amp;ln=en&amp;wrap_html=in
dexframe.htm">B&#228;renreiter</a>, also includes the more familiar 1833 version).

Also on the bill for Switzerland was a new work by one of the country's leading composers. <a href="http://swisscomposer.efat.ch/index.php">Fabian M&#252;ller</a>,
who is 45 this year, feels himself to be drawn most strongly to the ideals of musical impressionism.
His music is distinguished by its colourfulness and rhythmic variety and makes frequent reference to
the folk music of Switzerland (both rural and urban). His <i>Concerto per Klee</i> for cello and
chamber orchestra was recently premi&#232;red by Stephen Isserlis.

"That the Symphony sounded so delicate and lively owed less to the
music itself than to Hogwood's light touch, with which he encouraged
the broad bow-strokes, and stoked the joyful playing, of the
Austro-Hungarian Haydn Philharmonic."  <i><a href="http://www.nzz.ch/" title="Neue Z&#252;rcher Zeitung">Neue Z&#252;rcher Zeitung</a></i></p>
