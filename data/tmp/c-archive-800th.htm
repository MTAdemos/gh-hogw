<i>The University Of Cambridge: an 800th Anniversary Portrait</i>
 traces the development of the university from the Middle Ages to the 
modern day. It contains anecdotes from many past undergraduate and 
research students, including a contribution by Christopher which can be 
found below.</p>

<p>
<b>Inspiration, Refuge and Recreation <br>
Christopher Hogwood</b>

</p><p>
The sight of the choristers of King&#8216;s College processing from the Chapel
 after singing an evening service or anthem by Orlando Gibbons always 
carries (for me, at least) an extra historical frisson, realising that 
four hundred years earlier Gibbons himself at the age of 13 had been one
 of those choristers and had sung in this very same building (he was 
listed from 1596-9).</p>

<p>
The presence of the past used to strike many an undergraduate of my 
generation in their final summer term while listening to the fading 
strains of Sweet Suffolk Owl or The Silver Swan as the punts of the 
Madrigal Society (founded 1928, regrettably dissolved 1968) disappeared 
into the distance downriver. It still grips millions each year worldwide
 who tune in to the broadcast service of Nine Lessons and Carols, now 
entering its second century. Continuity is implicit in this frisson, but
 the atmosphere within the institution diverges increasingly from the 
pressures of the world outside, where the arts become more a refuge, 
less a recreation.

</p><p>
Chapel and chapel choirs remain the most permanent feature of 
Cambridge&#8216;s active music-making, in the process training many later 
professional voices, organ scholars and periodically producing 
close-harmony groups hoping to hit it as rich as the King&#8216;s Singers. 
</p><p>
A second strand of continuity is the University&#8217;s recognition of 
composition and living composers. I remember Britten, Tippett and 
Lutoslawski, receiving their honorary doctorates, just as earlier 
members of the University might have remembered Dvor&#225;k, Tchaikovsky, 
Saint-Saens or Ravel, their careers rotundly summarised in a Latin 
Oration. The post of Professor of Music was created in 1684 when Charles
 II demanded that Nicholas Staggins, his Master of Music, be awarded a 
MusD; the University retaliated by appointing him public Professor 
without salary. Since then the majority of appointments have also been 
composers (Maurice Greene, Thomas Walmisley, William Sterndale Bennet, 
Charles Villiers Stanford and, most recently, Alexander Goehr). This 
tradition was first broken in 1926 by the musicologist E. J. Dent and 
later by Thurston Dart (1962), both of whom overflowed academic barriers
 and busied themselves in &#8220;extra-mural&#8221; events: Dent with the ISCM and 
opera (at the same time presiding in 1926 over the first Music School 
&#8220;since the foundation of the University&#8221;), Thurston Dart with editing 
early music, international performance and recording. 
</p><p>
In the first years it was not obligatory for the Professor of Music to 
be resident in the University. Even Stanford, who as Organist of Trinity
 had worked so hard to encourage student performances, later fell out 
with the authorities and took to giving his harmony classes at the 
station before making the speediest possible return to London. 
Originally there had been no formal tuition, and a candidate for the 
Mus.B came to Cambridge solely to present his composition (an 
&#8220;exercise&#8221;), and usually paid for its performance as well. Until 
full-time music courses were initiated as recently as 1947, students 
could only come to music after several preparatory years in another 
discipline. Vaughan Williams (Trinity, 189?) had to read history before 
he could proceed to music. 
</p><p>
The Music Faculty now offers studies in history, analysis and 
compositional techniques as a springboard for diversifying into fields 
such as performance practice, early music, film music, jazz, the 
psychology of music and ethnomusicology. Not everyone reading music 
intends to become a professional; the prospectus mentions &#8220;financial 
and/or management careers&#8220; as possible other occupations, but the 
diplomatic service and deep-sea diving have also benefited. 
</p><p>
It is the live music of Cambridge which occupies and entertains the 
majority of students &#8212; and here the word is change rather than 
continuity, a flurry of maximum bravado (and usually minimum rehearsal) 
crammed into the few weeks of term and dependant on the time and talents
 of the natural impresarios. The most long-standing organisations are 
the Musical Society (CUMS, with symphony and chamber orchestras, wind 
ensemble and chorus), the Music Club (CUMC, with regular recitals by and
 for its members), the University Opera Society (formerly Group) and the
 very British Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Society. Other ventures have proved
 more transitory: the Cambridge Little Opera Group (possibly doomed by 
its unfortunate initials), the Decadent Music Union, the In Nomine 
Singers, the Purcell Society&#8230; 
</p><p>
Some fifty associations are currently listed, including the Brass Band 
Society, the Chinese Orchestra Society, the Hip-Hop Society and Homerton
 College Pandemonium Steel Pan Band. The common features are that they 
are open to all, vulnerable to the variable state of college 
music-making and financing, yet constantly producing natural leaders, 
who learn by trial and discordant error to control and mould the input 
of their peer musicians for whom music is not a chosen discipline, but 
simply a part of cultural life. 
</p><p>
Energy and resourcefulness are the hallmarks of college music &#8212;Wagner 
with 11 players and four singers, a full performance of Purcell&#8217;s Fairy 
Queen or Satie&#8217;s Vexations. My first hearing of the final scenes of Don 
Giovanni, was at a college musical evening, when the entry of the 
Commendatore (now a distinguished Law Lord) from the Dean&#8217;s bathroom 
nearly brought the piano accompaniment to a halt. 
</p><p>
Other University musicians achieved extra-mural fame: Raymond Leppard 
(Monteverdi operas), David Munrow (Early Music Consort and BBC) and now 
Christopher Page (Gothic Voices carried on to become &#8216;popularisers&#8216;, 
doing for music what Glyn Daniels did for archaeology or Stephen Hawking
 continues to do for cosmology. But it was never obligatory to be a 
member of the Music Faculty in order to take part in the practical 
music-making of Cambridge (some indeed have naughtily proposed that the 
reverse is true), just as it often turns out that a graduate in maths, 
Classics or Eng. Lit. may go on to a career as a professional musician. 
Of recent names such as John Eliot Gardiner, Andrew Davis, Anthony Pay, 
David Munrow, Roger Norrington, Emma Johnson, Robin Ticciati and Andrew 
Manze, fewer than half read music. 
</p><p>
Cambridge music has always mixed town with gown. A famous caricature of a
 Concert at Christ&#8216;s in 1767 shows the virtuoso Georg No&#235;lli playing the
 pantaleon with local professionals; the town music club organised 
performances in The Black Bear in the 18th and 19th centuries; the 
Cambridge Philharmonic was founded in 1833 and continues today; there 
were Thursday Concerts in the Guildhall where we regularly heard the 
Amadeus Quartet or Julius Katchen; and the annual Folk Festival has been
 going strong since 1965. Much was changed by the creation of a 
dedicated concert hall as part of the new Faculty buildings on the West 
Road site (1977), now home to professional series, regular opera and 
countless undergraduate ventures, with a range of musicians in residence
 (at the moment the Endellion String Quartet, the Britten Sinfonia and 
the Academy of Ancient Music). It has noticeably helped the rise of 
opera productions here; in addition to regular Handel operas, a recent 
student production of The Turn of the Screw showed how finely tuned high
 tension can be generated on a low-voltage budget. 
</p><p>
In this (like most academics) I have omitted mention of the pop world, 
although it is probable that the names of Cambridge town products such 
as Syd Barrett and Pink Floyd carry more resonance in the world than 
several centuries of University musicians combined. Similarly the name 
of the Fitzwilliam Museum is probably familiar to many musicians (for 
the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, only one of its many important holdings),
 unaware that it is in Cambridge and a splendid location for lunchtime 
recitals. 
</p><p>
From sublime chapel singing down to the scrawniest college quartet, 
Cambridge demonstrates that effective and rewarding music-making is here
 the province of the amateur. As a Fellow of Trinity so modestly put it 
in the 17th Century: 
</p><p>
&#8220;We have good Musick and Musicians here, <br>
If not the best, as good as any where&#8221; <br>
(Nicholas Hookes, &#8220;To Mr. Lilly, <br>
Musick-Master in Cambridge&#8221;, <br>
in Amanda, 1653)</p>
