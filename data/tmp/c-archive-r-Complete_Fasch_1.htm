 the younger (1736-1800), pupil and colleague of C.P.E. Bach in Hamburg,
 left only a few keyboard works for posterity since, on his deathbed, he
 asked his pupil Zelter to burn the contents of his music cabinet. This 
volume, the first of three, contains six sonatas that appeared in 
various prints during his lifetime and are also in an autograph MSS 
containing interesting variants; these are incorporated either in the 
body of the print, as also is the second version of the third movement 
of No. 4. or in the extensive critical commentary. All are in major keys
 (not exceeding two flats or one sharp) and in three movements (fast, 
slow, fast), apart from the first, which has an added minuet and trio. 
In No. 6, each movement is given a title of a personage in the manner of
 C.P.E. Bach's character pieces; at only five pages, it is by far the 
shortest, the final movement encompassing a mere sixteen bars.
</p><p>
The opening and closing allegros contain the characteristically nervous 
rhythmic and textural discontinuity with some abrupt changes. Quite 
widely spaced, two-part writing occurs frequently, as does a 
preludial-style melodic line of single notes divided between the hands; 
tricky hand shifts are necessary in several instances. The slow 
movements, through composed in Nos. 1-5 and a rondeau with couplets in 
No. 6, offer some highly dramatic moments, particularly No. 1, with its 
sweeping scale runs in sixty-fourth and one-hundred-twenty-eighth notes.
 No. 2 contains sharply dotted chordal writing, No. 4 repeated 
eighth-note chords, and No. 5 is a lyrical andante in 9/8.
</p><p>
A wide range of ornaments (the trill with prefix or suffix is frequently
 indicated) and articulation signs is used, the execution of which is 
covered in a table in the introduction. There is also a wide range of 
dynamic markings, which make these pieces particularly suited to the 
clavichord, as recommended in the posthumous edition by Rellstab (a 
well-balanced critical contemporary review is included here).
</p><p>
In addition to the execution and integration of the ornamentation, these
 pieces pose further technical challenges in several places, including 
ornaments in inner parts (as in the second and third movements of No. 
4), and the use of the thumb as a pivot, particularly in the single-note
 lines. The slow movement of No. 2 requires a stretch of a tenth between
 the held alto dotted half and the treble quarter notes. The composer's 
skill was attested to by such figures as Kirnberger and Reichardt, and 
this skill is evidenced in several movements, however, perseverance with
 the trickier passages will reap dividends. There is plenty of 
opportunity in each movement for the application of the phrasing and 
articulation available to the clavichordist.
</p><p>
The introduction gives a good overview of the composer's life, and 
provides the illuminating preface from Rellstab's 1805 edition of these 
six sonatas. The comprehensive critical notes offer alternative readings
 of some passages, taken from secondary and autograph sources. Not as 
quirkily "fantastic" or inventive as C.P.E. Bach's sonatas (but not 
predictable either), these sonatas reveal their intricacies after a few 
playings; they are of a higher standard of workmanship than those by 
many of his contemporaries. Five facsimiles, including autographs 
showing variants from the printed version, are a useful addition. The 
printing is of the usual clarity associated with Edition HH, and the 
volume is in the now familiar spiral binding with a wrap-over cover. The
 tireless efforts of Christopher Hogwood and his team of assistants, and
 the publisher Per Hartmanm, in making this repertoire available in such
 excellent editions deserve our thanks and appreciation.
