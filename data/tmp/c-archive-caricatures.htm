Some while ago a visit to the Göteborg Symphony Orchestra revealed a
number of surprises: the pleasantness of the town, the really excellent
art museum, the presence of Europe’s leading institution for research
into historical North German organs (GOART) plus one really wonderful
instrument that had been constructed under their leadership. All this in
 addition to a fine symphony orchestra and a most friendly Scandinavian
atmosphere — and as a late gift, long after I returned home, a surprise
package of several entertaining drawings of various maestri made by Ane
Lysebo, a member of the orchestra. Next time I will remember that I am
being watched with a caricaturist’s eye and restrain my mannerisms. Here
 are a couple of her views of conductors at work. I am waiting to see
who will be the first promoter to accept such drawings in lieu of the
normal conductor-photograph for the programme book...
