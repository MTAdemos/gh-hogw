As
 well as co-hosting the Symposium (with Bernard Brauchli), Christopher 
gave a paper on 'The Keyboard Music of Carl Fasch', which is printed in 
this volume; this, together with a thematic catalogue of Fasch&#8217;s 
keyboard music, introduces the new edition of all Fasch's keyboard 
works&nbsp;in three volumes which is being published in <a href="http://www.editionhh.co.uk/ab_fasch.htm" title="HHEdition">HHEdition.</a>
 (Volume I is already available, and Volumes II and III are in press). 
The music includes eight sonatas, several extended sets of variations 
and a number of short character pieces, the majority appearing for the 
first time in a modern edition. The thematic catalogue, the first of 
Fasch's keyboard music, includes all known sources (both printed and MS)
 and identifies several misattributions.

</p><p>
Christopher's article discusses various points relating to Fasch and his
 keyboard works: Fasch himself as a performer and teacher, appropriate 
instruments for his music, performance suggestions (such as appropriate 
ornaments), as well as an overview of Fasch's works (sonatas, character 
pieces, and variations).

</p><p>
The culmination of a rich gathering of experts in many disciplines, this
 volume contains articles by clavichord makers, musicologists and 
performers, and especially focuses on: the early clavichord from first 
iconographical documents to the earliest extant Instruments (organology 
and repertoire); the pedal clavichord, from its origins to the 
eighteenth century; the clavichord in the nineteenth century.
