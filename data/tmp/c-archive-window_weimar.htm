<img class="imgleft" src="upload/alt-weimar.jpg">Discovery
 of the last month was just how calm and civilised a place Weimar is. It
 was a first time visit for me (for Mozart concerts with the 
Staatskapelle Weimar), and almost every day of the week it snowed, 
rather romantically, on the medley of literary sites, once home to 
Schiller, Goethe, Heine and company; it also snowed on the gaunt library
 of Princess Anna Amalia, which burnt so tragically in September 2004 
(now under wraps and being restored to its former glamour, and due to 
reopen in 2007). However, many items of the music collection were lost, 
some irretrievably, and others now surviving only on microfilm. The 
librarians had the good sense to make saving Mozart&#8217;s autograph of K450 a
 priority, and I had a pleasant morning in the University library 
studying it.

For shelter from the weather, cosy and quiet restaurants and caf&#233;s were 
essential and not hard to find. On the corner of Schillerstrasse, the 
all-day Caf&#233; &amp; Restaurant Frauentor, with newspapers, windows for 
people watching, fine meals of all sizes (for vegetarians a 
much-recommended Gem&#252;setopf, a meal in itself and served at any time).

Hidden just behind the palatial Hochschule f&#252;r Musik is the Osteria 
Bertagnolli, Italian in name and ownership, but a cool version of 
Italian nouvelle, with light wood, rather superior wine-glasses (to go 
with an up-market wine-list) and background music which they obligingly 
turn off when asked (full marks).

The grandest food is found in the Michelin-starred Anna Amalia 
restaurant which is part of the Hotel Elephant on the market-square 
(looking quaint and original, but it fact mostly rebuilt); part of the 
hotel even covers the site of the house where C.P.E Bach was born while 
his father was stationed in Weimar. The dining room is in art deco 
style, plus hints of Wagner and more &#8212; superior in all senses.

The most welcoming discovery, however, was the restaurant Alt Weimar, 
housed in what was was once the home of Rudolf Steiner (but before he 
took against corners and right-angles in favour of having everything 
gently curved); not only music-free, but owned and run by a very 
cultivated and sociable lady, Gudrun Saacke, who attends all concerts 
and art events, chats knowledgeably at the table, delivers unexpected 
and free bottles of choice wine to the diners and makes sure that 
however late the concert ends there is a table available. The menu is 
also excellent and inventive, it goes without saying. Worth visiting 
Weimar just to sample it and the hospitality.
