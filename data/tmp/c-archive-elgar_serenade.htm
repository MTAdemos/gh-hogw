<img src="upload/elgar20note.jpg" alt="elgar20note.jpg" class="imgright" height="228" width="242">Until
 now, no edition has sought to reconcile the numerous disagreements 
between score and parts that have existed ever since the <i>Serenade</i>
 first appeared in print in 1893. Although Elgar's complete autograph 
manuscript has yet to be located, and the first printed edition must 
therefore be taken as the primary source, the task of resolving the 
latter's internal discrepancies has been informed by a recently 
rediscovered autograph manuscript of the first movement in its 
penultimate stage, as well as by manuscript and printed sources of 
Elgar's own arrangement for piano duet. The new edition includes a page 
of facsimile from the autograph of the piano duet showing where Elgar 
cancelled his original ending to the third movement before extending it 
to twice its length by the addition of material borrowed from the first 
movement.

</p><p>
At the end of his life, Elgar declared the <i>Serenade</i> to be his 
favourite work and it was included in his last recording session with 
the London Philharmonic Orchestra on 29 August 1933. In his 
Introduction, Christopher relates this recording to the printed score 
and demonstrates how performance practices have changed even in less 
than a century, highlighting the use by early twentieth-century string 
players of more portamento but less vibrato, and Elgar's cavalier 
attitude to his own metronome markings.

As ever, a full critical commentary is provided, and both (newly-corroborated) score and parts are available.</p>
