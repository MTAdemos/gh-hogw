In addition to being the Chairman of the Editorial Board for the publication of the <a href="http://www.cpebach.org/cpeb/">complete works of C.P.E. Bach</a>, Christopher also undertook to edit the six
collections of keyboard music <i>f&#252;r Kenner und Liebhaber</i> which Bach issued between 1779 and 1787.

    </div> <!-- leader -->

    <p>
Together these collections constitute C.P.E. Bach's 
largest-scale publishing venture and the preparation and sales (it was a
 'Selbstverlag' operation) occupied much of his energy for the final ten
 years of his life.
</p><p>
These collections have now appeared in two volumes (CPEB:CW Series I, 
vols 4.1 and 4.2) at the amazingly low price of $20 (&#163;12.50) a volume 
(thanks to the support and subvention of the <a href="http://www.packhum.org/phi/">Packard Humanities Institute</a> &#8212; would that more complete editions had such enlightened patronage).
</p><p>
In them you can find a mixture of Bach's most famous sonatas, rondos and
 fantasies suitable for both the clavichord and the forte-piano (and one
 alternative rondo movement included in the collection for the first 
time).
</p><p>
The aim of the edition as a whole is to have the complete works in print
 (some 109 volumes) by 2014, the 300th anniversary of Bach&#8217;s birth.
