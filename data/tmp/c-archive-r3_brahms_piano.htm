In &#8220;Music Matters&#8221; on BBC Radio 3 Saturday 21 January 
at 12:15 you can hear Christopher in conversation with Tom Service and 
Andr&#225;s Schiff about the newly-discovered short piano piece by Brahms 
which Christopher has edited for B&#228;renreiter Verlag; Andr&#225;s Schiff will 
give the first modern performance of this Albumblatt in the course of 
the programme and some of its problems as well as its unexpected 
connection with the Horn Trio Op 40 will be discussed and illustrated.  
Film clips of the studio session can be seen on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b019lzms">Music Matters website.</a>

Albumblatt, the short piece which lasts two minutes was written in 1853 
when Brahms was just 20. Musicologist Christopher Hogwood 'stumbled 
across' the piece as he looked through a music collection in the United 
States. The piece was originally found by Michael Struck when a book it 
was hidden within was being prepared for auction and he was asked for 
verification.

Radio 3 recorded Christopher Hogwood's shortly-to-be-published edition 
for the first time with the celebrated Hungarian pianist Andras Schiff 
and, in what will be a broadcast premiere, will play Albumblatt as part 
of an interview with Christopher Hogwood about the importance of the 
piece in advance of it being published for the first time by 
Barenreiter.

The work features the same theme as that in the Trio section of the 2nd 
movement of Brahms' Horn Trio op.40. However Hogwood, who has edited a 
forthcoming new edition of the Horn Trio op.40, says the piano piece 
precedes the Horn Trio by 12 years.

Controller of BBC Radio 3, Roger Wright, commented: "As the home of 
classical music, BBC Radio 3 is honoured to be the first to broadcast 
this rare work. I know that our millions of listeners will enjoy this 
exclusive broadcast premiere. Albumblatt is an incredible discovery 
which gives a fascinating insight into the workings of this great 
composer."

Following the broadcast premiere on Radio 3 on the 21st January at 
12:15pm, a behind-the-scenes video of the recording will be available on
 the Radio 3 website from 21st January after the programme transmits.
