In April, in the midst of the financial crisis, the UK
 Government issued the Budget it hoped would lead to recovery, and 
Christopher issued Graaf's <i>Duo Economique</i> to console us along the way...

Scored for two violinists reduced to sharing a single violin, the work 
demands the two players embrace a hitherto unfamiliar proximity: the 
photograph and the Introduction, below, explain all. The <i>Duo Economique</i>, edited by Christopher, is available now from <a href="http://www.editionhh.co.uk/hh243cat.htm">Edition HH</a>.

</p><p>
Christian Ernst Graaf (1723-1804) has earned his place in history as a 
footnote to Mozart's early life; as resident composer to the Dutch court
 at The Hague, he directed the "Grand Concert in the hall of the 'Oude 
Doelen'" on 30 September 1765 at which Leopold Mozart advertised "his 
son, only 8 years and 8 months old, and his daughter, 14 years of age". 
As well as playing concertos together, it was announced that "all the 
overtures [i.e. symphonies] will be from the hand of this young 
composer, who, never having found his like, has had the approbation of 
the Courts of Vienna, Versailles and London. Music-lovers may confront 
him with any music at will, and he will play everything at sight".
</p><p>
The young Mozart later complimented Graaf by publishing a set of "eight artful variations" (K.24) on Graaf's <i>Laat ons juichen, Batavieren!</i>,
 a patriotic song composed for the installation of the 18-year-old 
Willem V of Orange. Mozart senior wrote to friends back in Salzburg 
declaring "they are trifles" but, as a good father, adding "should you 
want to have a copy &#8230; you may do so, as they are unusual".
</p><p>
Graaf (originally Graf) came from Rudolstadt in Germany, but spent most 
of his long life as music director and Kapellmeister at the Dutch court,
 producing symphonies, chamber music and even, at the age of 79, a 
successful oratorio celebrating the peace between England and France in 
1802. The slightest and lightest of his works must be this unusual <i>Duo Economique</i>, requiring two players, two hands and two bows but only one violin.
</p><p>
The logistics of performance require a certain amount of intimacy 
(explained below), but the concept of such a duo (whether Graaf realised
 it or not) was hardly novel. John Dowland had produced and published 
"My Lord Chamberlaine his galliard" described as "an invention for two 
to play upon one lute" in 1597, and Tobias Hume produced a "Lesson for 
Two to Play upone one Viole" in 1603; for this two bows are required and
 the smaller of the two players is obliged to sit in the lap of the 
larger player.[<a href="#fn1">1</a>] Among classical composers, Wilhelm Friedrich Ernst 
Bach devised "Das Dreyblat" for one piano, six hands, where the 
gentleman sitting in the centre of the trio of players discovers that 
his part is set at the extreme top and extreme bottom of the keyboard 
while the other players occupy the middle register.

<b>Performers&#8217; Note</b> 
</p><p>
The first violinist holds the violin and bows near the bridge, playing, 
for the most part, in third position (or higher) on the upper two 
strings; the second stands behind and bows nearer the fingerboard, 
playing in first position on the lower two (occasionally three) strings.
 In bars 58, 60, 74 and 76 of the Rondo, the first violinist has to use 
lower strings and lower positions, but in these bars the second 
violinist is resting and so can simply remove their left hand, since 
this is not supporting the violin. For the second violinist to play C# 
on the G string is intimate but possible; the fourth finger is to be 
avoided &#8211; open Ds and As are much easier.
