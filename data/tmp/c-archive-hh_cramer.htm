Christopher's latest publication with <a href="http://www.editionhh.co.uk/hh193cat.htm">Edition HH</a>
 is of the three sonatas of 1799, dedicated to Haydn, by German-born, 
London-based Johann Baptist Cramer (1771-1858). The sonatas reveal 
Cramer's preference for the sustaining power of the latest Broadwood 
pianofortes as well as the strength of his interest in music of the 
past.

    <p>
Unlike many of his bravura contemporaries, Cramer regarded himself as a 
Mozartian by temperament, and intellectually a devotee of J. S. Bach. 
Beethoven considered him to be the best of all living pianists, 
recommending him as a teacher, and the English knew him affectionately 
as "Glorious John", a compliment to his refined nature and flawless 
musical style (and an acknowledgement of his long-term residency in 
London).</p>

<p>
The present set of three contrasted sonatas was dedicated to Haydn and 
first published in Vienna in 1799, shortly after Cramer had met the 
composer. A contemporary criticism noted that they were "more economical
 than usual", and their technical restraint and formality make them a 
perfect tribute to the previous century; the third sonata, for example, 
opens with a type of arpeggiated prelude that harks back to Bach and the
 baroque, while also looking forwards to Mendelssohn. All three works 
are models of classical clarity, and Cramer exploits the full range and 
sonority of the fortepiano, with exact indications of pedalling and 
dynamics. This edition also includes extracts from his <i>Instructions for the Piano Forte</i>, which explain his ornamentation and markings, even distinguishing between the grand piano and the
smaller, square piano.</p>

<p>
Also newly-available from Edition HH is a separate piano part for Christopher's 2008 edition of Mozart's <i>Grand Quintetto</i>, an
arrangement by Schwenke of the <i>Gran Partita</i> K361: pianists may now enjoy the luxury of fewer page-turns than are to be met when playing from the score.
