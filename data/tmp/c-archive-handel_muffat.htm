6 Fugues for Keyboard (1735)<br>
HWV 605-610<br>
'mises dans une autre applicature pour la facilit&#233; de la main'<br>
by Gottlieb Muffat (1736)</b>
</p><p>
The second volume in the Handel/Muffat series edited by Christopher is available now, published by Ut Orpheus.
</p><p>
Although Handel and Gottlieb Muffat (1690-1770) &#8211; &#8216;the other Amadeus&#8217;, 
son of the composer Georg Muffat &#8211; never met, Muffat&#8217;s name is well 
known to Handelians as the source of the extensive but unacknowledged 
&#8216;borrowings&#8217; Handel made in his Ode for St Cecilia&#8217;s Day and the 
Concerti Grossi Op. 6, all deriving from Muffat&#8217;s Componimenti musicali 
published in 1739. There are also modified quotations from Muffat in the
 Op. 7 Organ Concerti and in Judas Maccabaeus, Joshua, Solomon and 
Theodora.
</p><p>
The present editions aim to redress the balance by presenting Muffat&#8217;s 
acknowledged &#8216;recreations&#8217; of Handel&#8217;s most famous keyboard 
publications. The first volume contains the 8 Suites (Suite des Pieces 
Pour le Clavecin, first issued in 1720), found in Muffat&#8217;s own autograph
 in the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin (Mus.ms 9160). The second volume 
includes the set of 6 Fugues (Six Fugues or Voluntarys of 1735).
</p><p>
While these Handel originals have been well served by modern 
scholarship, until now this important alternative version of the suites 
and fugues has never been published.
