In August 1795, as Joseph Haydn was about to leave for Vienna, one of 
his final acts in London was to sign over to the impresario and 
orchestra leader J. P. Salomon the rights on the first six of the London
 symphonies. In late February of the following year Haydn despatched 
from Vienna the contract for the remaining six, handing over to Salomon 
the right to exploit all twelve as he saw fit.
</p><p>
It&#8217;s interesting that Salomon left the dissemination of the symphonies 
in their orchestral form to others; the music publishers Andr&#233;, Artaria,
 Simrock and Imbault were quick off the mark with editions. From his 
collection, which consisted of the complete performing parts of all 
twelve symphonies, along with the autographs of Nos 95 and 96 and scores
 freshly copied from the autographs of the remaining ten &#8212; material 
which would pass, at his death, to William Ayrton and through him to the
 Royal Philharmonic Society &#8212; Salomon resolved to make two separate 
reductions of the entire set for home enjoyment or chamber performance.
</p><p>
<img class="imgleft" src="upload/fhvl1s.jpg">In
 publishing them it is clear that his aim was the widest dissemination 
of these remarkable works. First came transcriptions &#8216;Adapted for the 
Piano Forte, with an Accompaniment for a Violin &amp; Violoncello, (ad 
libitum)&#8217;, a purely sociable prescription since the entire musical 
content is lodged in the keyboard part. These came out in three uneven 
batches between June 1796 and October the following year: four at first,
 then two, then the final six together. A fair representation of Haydn&#8217;s
 symphonic texture could hardly be expected of this trio treatment. 
Salomon answered that objection in his fuller &#8216;quintetto&#8217; arrangements &#8212;
 announced in <i>The Times</i> on 19 June 1798 &#8212; &#8216;for five Instruments, 
vizt. Two Violins, a German Flute, a Tenor, and a Violoncello: with an 
Accompaniment for the Piano Forte ad libitum. ... Pr. 15s ... NB A 
separate Bass Part pr. 2s 6d&#8217;. Crucially, the fuller arrangement 
decreases the role of the keyboard instrument, and the flute and viola 
come in as extra melodic and colouristic resources.
</p><p>
As a vehicle for orchestral transcription this scarcely precedented 
combination proved immediately successful. Salomon negotiated 
publication in Bonn with Simrock, who had already issued the trio 
arrangements; this was announced in March 1799. After Haydn&#8217;s death in 
1809, Salomon transferred the material to his colleague Robert Birchall;
 he in turn passed it on to his son-in-law Richard Mills. Both Birchall 
and Mills &#8212; the latter as late as 1830 &#8212; reissued the quintettos with 
their own revisions. It has always been assumed erroneously that they 
were identical and have unwittingly been used thus for reference and 
recording, e.g. by Harry Newstone for his provocative Eulenburg edition 
of the London symphonies (1992). Fortunately, Salomon&#8217;s autograph score,
 used for the first engraving, not only clarifies his intentions, but in
 it (as a composing copy) we can trace his procedures and experiments, 
and garner evidence both of the changes that overtook the London 
versions of these pieces, and of that collaboration between author and 
performer which was so much part of eighteenth-century musical practice.
 With Salomon we have the contribution of a performing musician who 
worked alongside Haydn from the conception of many of these symphonies, 
and saw them through first (and consequent) performances and eventually 
into print in a variety of forms.

&#8216;XII GRAND SYMPHONIES , By HAYDN, arranged as Quintets, by J. P. 
SALOMON. (The original Score in Mr. Salomon&#8217;s hand-writing.)&#8217; is 
handwritten in a printed nineteenth-century cartouche on the title page 
of Salomon&#8217;s score, originally two volumes and now bound as one. The 
description and the binding are probably the work of William Ayrton, 
heir to Salomon&#8217;s music collection at his death in 1815. There is no 
mention of the volume in the sale of Ayrton&#8217;s musical effects in 1858, 
the only clue to its whereabouts for nearly a century being a bookplate 
of the collector Edward Wrey Whinfield (died 1904). The adventures by 
which it crossed the Atlantic and ended up in the 1950s in the hands of 
the noted Hollywood film-score composer Alfred Newman are obscure; but 
at his death Newman&#8217;s collection of music scores passed to the 
Cinema-Television Library and Archives of Performing Arts, University of
 Southern California in Los Angeles.
</p><p>
The manuscript is written on English paper 9 1/2 x 11 3/4 inches, 
watermarked with a crown over fleur-de-lys in shield and &#8216;GR 1794&#8217;. The 
date (if any indication of the year of composition) is surprisingly 
early; Salomon had no contract with Haydn until the following year, and 
yet the hasty script, particularly in the later symphonies, is obviously
 under pressure &#8212; as if to suggest performances of the quintettos in MS 
before publication, maybe even before Haydn&#8217;s departure.
</p><p>
The symphonies, numbered I-XII, are arranged in the order current in 
Salomon&#8217;s time. In modern terms that makes the running order No. 97 
(actually the <i>last</i> of the symphonies composed and presented by 
Haydn during his first London visit), then 93, 94, 98, 95 and 96; the 
original second volume is devoted to Nos. 104, 103, 102, 99, 101 and 
100.
</p><p>
The score is laid out for Flauto, Viol. 1mo, Viol. 2do, Viola and 
Violoncello (replacing &#8216;Basso&#8217; which has been erased at the start of 
Symphony I, i.e. 97). There is no indication of an independent 
double-bass line in the arrangement; the separate &#8216;Bass&#8217; part advertised
 by the publishers was probably to free the cellist from the 
inconvenience of playing from the left hand of the pianoforte part. 
Salomon&#8217;s score contains no written-out keyboard part; the bass line is 
figured at first, fully in Symphony I, sparsely in II, and thereafter 
not at all.
</p><p>
For a fuller study of the relationship between these arrangements and 
other sources, and a survey of Salomon&#8217;s working methods, the reader is 
referred to the present author&#8217;s &#8220;In praise of arrangements: the 
&#8216;Symphony Quintetto&#8217;&#8221;, in <i>Studies in Music History</i> presented to H. C. Robbins Landon (ed. Otto Biba and David Wyn Jones), Thames &amp; Hudson, 
London, 1996, p. 82ff.
</p><p>
For this edition of Symphony I/97, Salomon&#8217;s manuscript is the prime 
source of the quintet parts; the keyboard part is taken from the printed
 material published by Salomon (London 1798, reissued by Birchall 
c.1820), and this has also been used to supplement problematic passages 
in the manuscript. The manuscript contains rehearsal letters probably 
added by Salomon (the letter &#8216;I&#8217; is avoided, in the German manner) and 
these have been included in this edition as an early example of such 
under-examined devices. From their sometimes surprising frequency and 
positioning (always before an up-beat) one deduces an experienced 
practical director with prior knowledge of difficult passages. The 
Critical Commentary gives important divergences, together with 
references to the original orchestral version and occasional ossias in 
the main text.
</p><p>
Many of the changes in bowing and dynamics (such as the &#8216;sf&#8217; marks added
 throughout the Menuetto, and Salomon&#8217;s marking up the &#8216;brass&#8217; parts 
above the prevailing dynamic in the second and fourth movements) will be
 intriguing and possibly useful to orchestral directors. For once, the 
question of whether or not to play repeats in a Menuetto da capo is 
irrelevant, since both minuet and trio are written out in full &#8212; a 
useful confirmation of what was then considered the norm. (For more on 
the subject of repeats and the tempos of minuets, see the present 
writer&#8217;s &#8216;In praise of the minuet and trio&#8217;, <i>Early Music</i>, vol. 
XXX/2, May 2002, pp. 236&#8211;51). The famous violin solo provided by Haydn 
at the end of the trio for &#8216;Salomon Solo ma piano&#8217;, the arranger 
graciously gives to the flute.
</p><p>
Symphony 97 is the only one in Salomon&#8217;s MS with an (almost) fully 
figured bass line (the figuring gives up after bar 82 of the last 
movement), although some awkwardness of script and placement shows that 
it was added later (and possibly not by Salomon). The keyboard part 
published by Salomon in 1798 is probably the work of another hand, and 
frequently adopts solutions other than the figuring suggests. However, 
as a fully written-out version of what we must consider an acceptable 
late-eighteenth-century symphonic continuo part, it is valuable in its 
simplicity and effectiveness.
