Edited by Christopher Hogwood<br>
Edition HH, 2003<br>
hh70.sol; ISMN M 708024 94 1; ISBN 1 904229 40 9</b>
</p><p>
A hitherto unpublished collection of keyboard music, suitable for 
harpsichord and organ, but specifically mentioning the clavichord, from 
the 1680s. Amongst the varied dance movements and suites is music by 
Lully, La Barre, John Roberts and Thomas Farmer. This collection shows 
the strong influence of French keyboard music on English taste, and is 
also extensively marked with original fingering, of great value to the 
modern performer. An extended set of bravura variations on <i>La Folia</i>,
 and two colourful organ voluntaries add contrast to this tuneful 
selection of domestic music. With an introduction, concordances and 
critical notes by Christopher.
