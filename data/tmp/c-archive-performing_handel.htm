 Hogwood CBE delivered the Stanley Sadie Memorial Lecture in the elegant
 surroundings of the Royal Institute to a packed audience of Handelian 
fans (if that is not too plebeian a word) with his usual blend of 
erudition and humour. He did not want us to think that he would be 
laying down the law as to how Handel should be performed, but rather 
would be telling us how Handel was being performed at various times 
through the ages. Handel was an ideal subject for this study because 
almost uniquely he had never "left the stage" since his own time.

We were treated to several carefully compiled selections of Handel's 
music, from an 1888 recording with a 3,000 strong choir to an audience 
of 23,722 to up-to-date recordings made in the last few years. 
Descriptions ranged from the forces used in the first centenary 
celebration in 1774 (slight miscalculation) with roughly 30 professional
 singers and 30 orchestral players, including only 4 violins and 2 
oboes, to a monster orchestra to support a vast choir of amateur singers
 from every part of the Kingdom. Burney was quoted to support the early 
descriptions.

Mozart used Messiah as a vehicle for showing off his compositional
virtuosity by adding possibly inappropriate additional instruments and 
richer harmonies, typically in the aria 'The people who walked in 
darkness' which Handel probably meant to be scored rather bleakly to 
achieve contrast with "a great light."
</p><p>
Changes had been made to voice types and Mr Hogwood particularly missed 
the quality of true contraltos like Clara Butt and Monica Sinclair. He 
did not feel that counter tenors whose use outside the church context 
would probably have amazed Handel were at all appropriate. He also felt 
that performing staged versions of oratorios risked destroying Handel's 
dramatic intentions. Handel would never have left the chorus standing 
uncomfortably on stage while the soloist performed a long da capo aria.

The study of writings by Ernest Irving who wrote the music accompanying the 1942 film <i>The Great Mr Handel</i>
 had some interesting things to say about his thought processes even 
though he seems to have not always been well informed about what 
instrumentation Handel had actually used. The writings of Thomas Beecham
 and Malcolm Sergeant were quoted. Both had introduced changes which 
were more about their personal preference than any attempt to fulfil 
Handel's intentions. It was interesting to be told that Mendelssohn had 
taken some risks in offending Moscheles by refusing to be led into 
introducing post composition editorial changes - clearly on the side of 
the Angels.
</p><p>
In the 1960s and 70s the rise of Historically Informed Performance has 
led to some stripping away of incorrect performance practice. An early 
exponent was Arnold Dolmetsch who introduced the concept of double 
dotting and adding trills and ornaments on the grounds that they were 
consistent with the conventions of the time even if not specifically 
written out. The use of &#8220;correct instruments" had its pitfalls too. The 
right instrument in the wrong hand could be disastrous.
</p><p>
Mr Hogwood made a plea that scholars should be listened to, as they were
 often able to guide performers into more appropriate practices than 
just using their instincts. The practice of imitating which seems common
 today had problems if the model used had its own errors. He also felt 
that although Handel was a giant we should make more of an attempt to 
revive the music of Handel's contemporaries like Handel pasticcios 
produced by J C Smith, Leo, Vinci and Hasse, not to mention the music of
 Arne and Festing. Instead of repeating the same works more effort 
should be made to uncover works like Handel's 100 cantatas so far 
unperformed.

The talk was very enthusiastically received.
