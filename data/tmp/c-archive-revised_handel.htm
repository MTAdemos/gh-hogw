<img class="imgleft" src="upload/Handelcover.jpg">'One
 cannot always be praising Homer': thus the over-enthusiasm of 
nineteenth-century Handelians was countered, somewhat wearily, by Franz 
Liszt. Hagiography, posthumous fictions and picaresque novels are the 
legacy of these zealots in Handel's cause, for whom the Myth 
overshadowed attempts at studied biography and musical documentation 
which might have led them closer to Handel the Man. Even in his own 
lifetime Handel passed from being an individual to an institution, and 
eventually a complete industry; since his death, a reputation founded on
 endless repetitions of a small core of compositions has held Handel 
firmly captive. His compositions, according to Sir Donald Tovey's 
calculations, equal almost all those of Bach plus all of Beethoven &#8211; yet
 the overwhelming public preference for just one work has meant that 
most of this great output remains unfamiliar. 'His reputation is 
unshakably founded on one piece &#8212; <i>Messiah</i> &#8212; which represents an 
infinitesimal part of his enormous output, and yet which so 
comprehensively represents it that further exploration of his music 
never ultimately adds much' (<i>The Spectator</i> 12 May 1984). Hallowed
 by the traditions of two centuries, misconceptions of this kind still 
represent the popular image of Handel today, totally ignoring the major 
arena of his work...
</p><p>
...Since 1984, the heightened awareness of Handel's operatic genius that
 we prayed for in the last century seems finally to have come about and 
many positions have changed, including my own.
