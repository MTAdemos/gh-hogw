This is the first of three articles by Christopher (on very different subjects) to be published in <a href="http://em.oxfordjournals.org/" title="<i>Early Music</i>"><i>Early Music</i></a>
 this year (Volume 40, Issue 4). The other two will be about the 
keyboard music of John Dowland, and (for their 40th anniversary issue) 
the problems of <i>Urtext</i> and <i>Fassung letzter Hand</i> and the benefits of Process Editions.

The article draws on Christopher's on-going work editing the <i>Complete Sonatas for Keyboard</i> for

Leopold Ko&#382;eluch (1747-1818), the most influential of the many Bohemian 
musicians then working in Vienna, was by the end of the eighteenth 
century &#8220;the most celebrated [composer] in all of musical Europe&#8221; &#8212; more
 admired than Mozart and Haydn, and this despite his refusal to perform 
in public. Credited with inspiring the &#8220;vogue of the fortepiano&#8221;, his 
fifty solo keyboard sonatas represented the final stand against the 
impending division between professional and amateur music-making. 
Although their &#8220;pure&#8221; and &#8220;pleasing&#8221; qualities fell out of fashion 
amidst the musical agitations of the nineteenth century, they are 
&#8216;classics&#8217; in the true sense of the word, recognised by late 
eighteenth-century theorists as perfect models of the genre. They are 
also fundamental to improving an understanding of the general musical 
landscape of the Classical period so often distorted by a focus on great
 masters to whom Ko&#382;eluch is inevitably considered to be &#8220;subsidiary&#8221;, a
 dismissal which has allowed his innovations &#8212; the <i>cantabile</i> 
idiom; the tragic-pathetic manner inherited by Schubert and Beethoven &#8212; 
to be overlooked. In this essay a thorough survey of Ko&#382;eluch&#8217;s keyboard
 sonatas, and of contemporary responses to them, makes it possible to 
appreciate a composer who held firm to an aesthetic increasingly 
abandoned by successors whose assessments remain largely unchallenged, 
and to share in Susan Burney&#8217;s &#8220;gratification of finding Kozeluch <i>triumphant over all prejudices</i>&#8221;.</p>
