Ensure there is a </div> to end maincontent in archive content 


add <br clear=both> to range of things that canbe added in editing

swap apostrophes/inverted commas /endash/emdash to HTML entities after pasting


suppress Mdiv class=leader> if empty




1) check to see if there is an accumulation of <br clear=both class=clearbeforeclicktoedit> -- probably needs explicit removal in end_edit() or save()
