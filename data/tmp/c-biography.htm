Christopher
 Hogwood has worked with most leading symphony orchestras and opera
houses in the world. Once described as "the von Karajan of early music",
 he is universally acknowledged as one of the most influential exponents
 of the historically informed early-music movement. He is equally
passionate about music of the 19th and 20th centuries: with a particular
 focus on the Early Romantics and the neo-classical school (Martin&#367;,
Stravinsky, Britten, Copland, Tippett and Honegger), he applies the same
 rigour and supreme musicianship to all his work, striving to discover
and to recreate the composer&#8217;s intentions both in notation and
performance. "His name is a byword for excellence of playing and quality
 of supporting scholarship" (BBC Music Magazine).

Highlights among future projects include a 4-concert series with the
Beethovenorchester Bonn focusing on classical and neo-classical
repertoire, symphonic projects with the Bayerische Staatsorchester
Munich, WDR Sinfonieorchester K&#246;ln, Bremer Philharmoniker, Frankfurter
Museumsorchester, Warsaw Philharmonic, RAI Orchestra Turin, Maggio
Musicale Florence, concerts at the Prague Spring and Grafenegg
festivals, as well as a revival of <i>Le Nozze di Figaro</i> at the Opernhaus Z&#252;rich.

Christopher Hogwood's reputation as one of the world's most eloquent
advocates of period performance was recently acknowledged in Asia where
he received the Beijing Music Festival's 2010 <i>Artist of the Year</i>
award for his contribution to Baroque music, following a highly
successful tour conducting orchestras in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Guangzhou
and Beijing.

His conducting projects are closely connected to his research and
editing work. He is in the process of a completing a new edition of
Mendelssohn's orchestral works for B&#228;renreiter and sits on the board of
the Martin&#367; Complete Edition and the C.P.E. Bach Complete Works Edition.
 In 2010 he launched his latest project as General Editor of the new
Geminiani Opera Omnia for Ut Orpheus Edizioni in Bologna.

Christopher Hogwood's discography, which includes the complete Mozart
and Beethoven symphonies, boasts over 200 recordings with the Academy of
 Ancient Music on Decca, many of which have attracted some of the
world's most prestigious awards.
