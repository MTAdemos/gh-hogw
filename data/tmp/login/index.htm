<h1>Login page</h1>

<div id=logintext>
  <p class=b0>
  You are now logged in to edit things on Christopher Hogwood&#146;s web site.
  Things which are now editable will have a &#147;click to edit&#148; link beneath them.
  <A href="../index.htm">Click here</a> to return to the home page to navigate round the site
  and edit things.

  <p class=b1>
  By default you will remain logged in (and able to edit things) until you close the browser. If you want to explicitly log out, so that you can see what the site looks like without the &#147;click to edit&#148; links, then click this link:
  <A href="javascript:createCookie('loggedin',0,-1);">log out</a>.

<div id=ietext>
  <h2>Internet explorer &#151; warning</h2>

  <p>
  <p class=b0>
  You appear to be using Internet Explorer to look at this site.

  <p class=b0>
  There are some significant differences between Internet Explorer and most other browsers,
  though these are starting to reduce with the arrival of Internet Explorer version 9.

  <p class=b0>
  These are not normally obvious in looking at web sites, but make a big difference
  to how newer facilities are interacted with by the scripting on a web site.
  This applies to some of the things used to enabling of the editing of this site.
  Rather than spend lots of extra time that editing also works in Internet Explorer,
  it seems wiser to disable editing with Internet Explorer for the
  time being.

  <p class=b0>
  Please come back to this page with another browser, such as
  <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/" target="new">Firefox</a>.

  <p class=b0>
  This restriction only applies to <i>editing</i> the site. Things will look as good
  if people visit the site with Internet Explorer as if they use another browser.

  </p>

<p>&nbsp;<p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p class=b0>
The editing facility applies only to those parts of the web
site which have been explicitly set to be editable. Going
back to the main site from this page, you will see a band
under each thing which can be made editable links saying
&#147;click to edit&#148; and &#147;save&#148;, and for
things following a preset pattern, there are also links
saying &#147;new&#148; and &#147;delete&#148;.

<p class=b1>
Clicking &#147;click to edit&#148; makes the entry editable
&#151; it is possible to type in new words, or to highlight
some words and then use one of the links below to alter it.
</p>

<H2>Changing text</h2>
<p class=b0>
As a general rule of thumb, it is best to add new text and then delete what is there. 

<p class=b1>
The reason for this is that if you delete all of the text for something, you are likely also to delete the marker that says where the new text should go. I have 
done some things to mitigate this, but is hard to more without making things look very different when they are being edited.    
</p>

<H2>Moving things up and down</h2>
<p class=b0>
The pink boxes you click to edit things are at the bottom of each editable chunk of the page. At the left are arrows pointing up and down: clicking one of these 
will cause the section in question to swap places with the one above or below. This is a way, for example, of moving discography entries or news stories. 
</p>

<h2>Images</h2>
<p class=b0>
The buttons at the bottom of an area being edited
make changes to the text currently highlighted.
<b>To add an image</b>, highlight some text click one one of the buttons
to add images, and the text highlighted will be replaced with the image
(aligned left, right or centred depending on which button you clicked).
<p class=b1>
As the photo replaces the text that was highlighted, people often
type a few random characters to give themselves something to replace
with the photo.
<p class=b1>
The photo will appear at the same size aas it is on your computer. To change
the size of the photo, you should re-size it before uploading. Lots of graphics software
can do this &#151; the program people often talk about is Photoshop,
which is qutei expensive, but there is a free, open-source alternative called
<a href="http://www.gimp.org" target="new">Gimp</a>
available from
<a href="http://www.gimp.org" target="new">www.gimp.org</a>.
A potential future upgrade to this editing facility would be to make the
web site do the re-sizing, but often people get better results if they
crop and re-size a photo in graphics software.

<p class=b1>
To <b>delete an image</b> all you need to do is click on the image and press delete
(to remove it) or start typing (to replace it with words). To replace one image with another
highlight the image and click one of the buttons to add an image.

<p class=b1>
<b>Borders:</b> Sometimes there is a case for putting a dark line round the edge of an image &#151; typically if
its background is so pale that it is not easy to distinguish from the background colour. If you
click the checkbox for a dark border, then a dark border is added (if you uncheck the tick box the
border goes away). You may need to click to end editing and then click to edit again before this
becomes available.

<p class=b1>
<b>Captions:</b> the word &#147;CAPTION&#148; appears below all newly-uploaded images &#151;
which can be edited to the words actually wanted for the caption.

<h2>Secondary images</h2>
<p class=b0>
Sometimes it is good to be able to click on an image and see a large version.
This is enabled by clicking on an image and the clicking the &#147;Add secondary image&#148; button.

Thought the large and small versions are of the same thing, they need to have different names (otherwise the
large one will over-write the small one). One way to do this is to add a suffix like &#147;-big&#148; to the 
file for the large version.

<h2>Paragraphs</h2>
<p class=b0>
To turn some text into a new paragraph, highlight it and click &#147;paragraph&#148;; clicking
&#147;quote paragraph&#148; creats a new paragraph with the text right and left indented.

<h2>Special characters</h2>
<p class=b0>
It isn&#146;t always as easy as it might be to get opening or closing single or double quotes, endashes
or emdashes when typing into a web browser. To make these available some &#147;special
characters&#148;
are provided. To use these, highlight something in the text and click on one of the special
characters, which will then replace what was highlighted.

<h2>&#147;Show maincontent&#148; and &#147;Show content&#148;</h2>
<p class=b0>
These are provided for debugging purposes and it will make sense to remove them befor ethe site
goes live.
</p>


<h2>Saving or discarding edits</h2>
<p class=b0>
The edits you have made will only be saved when you click &#147;save&#148.
If you have been experimenting and want to discard what you have been doing, it is enough
simply to reload the page.
</p>


<h2>Archive</h2>
<p class=b0>
Stories on the news page have a &#147;to archive&#148; option when available for editing: clicking
on this removes the story from the news page (and menu) and provides menus for adding it to the
archive.
