This is the first of Christopher&#8217;s two contributions to the newly-published <i>De Clavicordio VI</i>, which introduces the material published in his edition of <i>&#8216;fitt for the Manicorde&#8217;</i>,
published in October 2003 by Edition HH.

<b>The Clavichord and its repertoire in France and England before 1700 &#8212; a summary and a new manuscript source</b>
</p><p>
Any suggestion of a clavichord presence in England or France is usually 
rebuffed with quotations such as: &#8216;A land without clavichords&#8217; 
(reportedly said of England) and &#8216;a box of flies&#8217;, (a description of the
 clavichord by the French). If the proposition merits a third nail it 
will surely come from John Robinson, who complained that &#8216;The clavichord
 gives a fretful waspish kind of sound, not at all suited to tender 
expression&#8217; (Supplement to <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, 1801). All three quotes are retrospective and none evaluates the evidence logcally.
</p><p>
It is certainly true that, although there were clavichord makers in 
France and in England, no instruments manufactured in France, and few 
(if any) manufactured in England have survived &#8212; the instrument 
attributed to &#8216;Peter Hicks&#8217; in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum is a 
puzzling rogue. The <i>Musicalischer Almanach f&#252;r Deutschland</i> announced in 1782, that
</p><p>
<i>As is known, the English do not make any clavichords at all.</i>
</p><p>
About their presence in England, Mattheson (<i>Critica Musica</i>, 1722) pointed out that:
</p><p class="quote">
<i>When it is said that clavichords are to be found nowhere but in 
Germany, and then, that a clavichord has been heard in England in the 
home of a German organist, then [one must conclude that] there must be 
clavichords in England, at least among the Germans there (of which there
 are quite a few now). There are people living here in Hamburg who each 
year send as many clavichords as they can make to England, Spain, 
Holland, etc. So where are [these clavichords]?</i>
</p><p>
The &#8216;box of flies&#8217; quote appears to stem from a more recent source, Robert Wangerm&#233;&#8217;s <i>La musique flamande dans la Soci&#233;t&#233; des XVe et XVIe si&#232;cles</i>
 (Brussels: Arcade, 1965), where he escribes the clavichord as sounding 
like a &#8216;concert de mouches&#8217;. For the third, &#8216;waspish&#8217; quote it is worth 
reinstating the reputation of Mr Robinson a little, since that one 
critical phrase is so often taken out of context. John Robinson, 
(1739&#8211;1805) was not, as many assume, a bad-tempered journalist with 
pretensions to modernist sensibilities, but am immensely learned 
Scottish authority pn physics, stronomy, mathematics and mechanics, and 
also an expert on keyboard instruments and temperament (he described a 
fascinating type of clavichord which he claimed was invented by Euler, 
and of which no other description exists).
</p><p>
We assume the piano, like the organ (metal, wood, reed or bamboo) to 
have no frontiers. But rarities in other categories like the <i>cimbasso</i>, eulean pipes, <i>bandoneon</i>, <i>ud</i>, sitar, <i>didgeridoo</i>
 and many others are readily definable and the instruments appear 
strikingly exotic outside their home territories. Can the same, however,
 have been true for an instrument as long lasting, simple and basic as 
the clavichord within Europe?
</p><p>
There is here a danger of confusing the country of origin with the field
 of performance and we must distinguish, for instance, between 
clavichord music in France and music from France played on the 
clavichord elsewhere.
</p><p> &nbsp;
</p><p>
The presence of French music in foreign sources, both printed and 
manuscript (such as L&#252;neburg, Ratsb&#252;cherei, Mus. ant. pract. 1198, 
c.1687, and many Scandinavian tablature sources listed in Jan Olof 
Rud&#233;n, <i>Music in tablature</i>, [Stockholm, 1981]) suggest performance of this repertoire on the clavichord was widespread outside France. Marpurg (<i>Kritische Briefe</i>,
 1760) includes Dandrieu amongst his selected keyboard pieces for the 
instrument, and the Austrian monk Maximilian Piessinger, (c.1780) 
declared certain French music (including Couperin) best on clavichord; 
Bach himself, of course, copied out Couperin&#8217;s <i>Les Moissonneurs</i> in the <i>Notenbuch f&#252;r Anna Magdalena Bach</i>
 which would surely have been played on the clavichord in the Bach 
household. The sole occurrence of French keyboard music in an English 
manuscript that mentions the &#8216;manicorde&#8217; was recently published in the 
volume <i>&#8216;fitt for the Manicorde&#8217;</i> (Edition HH, 2003).
</p><p>
Another source of confusion is the assumption that the requisite or 
preferred instrument will be automatically mentioned in the title of a 
keyboard volume. Manuscript keyboard collections generally gave prime 
place to the owner&#8217;s name not the instrument, for obvious reasons. Only 
organ music was sometimes specifically marked as such, and later 
designations such as the English &#8216;virginals books&#8217; are misleading. <i>Elizabeth Rogers&#8217; Virginal Book</i>,
 for example, usually described as the &#8216;last of the virginal books&#8217; is 
actually the first and only one to use the name of the instrument in its
 title. Similar familiar titles were in fact applied well after the 
event: <i>The Fitzwilliam Virginal Book</i>, <i>My Lady Nevells Virginal Book</i>
 and similar were given these workiing titles long after they were 
written. The number of occurences of such a title, and in fact the 
number of individual pieces described as suitable for &#8216;virginalls&#8217; is 
relatively small. If direct references to the ubiquitous and 
highly-visible virginals are so few, what hope for the more private 
clavichord?
</p><p>
Here are ten &#8216;signals&#8216; (in declining order of explicitness) that may help to decide the &#8216;designated keyboard&#8217; question:
</p><p>
&#8226; Evidence in the title: &#8216;A Pavan for the Virginals&#8216;, &#8216;Allemande for the
 clavichord&#8216; (such indications are rare; for the only known English 
clavichord example see the second part of this paper).
</p><p>
&#8226; The generic title or nature of the volume (domestic, church) &#8212; though 
many collections are mixed &#8212; or the notation (e.g. tabulature notation 
which is instrument specific)
</p><p>
&#8226; Internal evidence of the piece (e.g. Peter Philips&#8216; <i>Pavan dolorosa</i>
 which requires the use split keys and short octave; also many English 
organ voluntaries which imply the use of organ registers divided between
 C and C sharp)
</p><p>
&#8226; The range and chromaticism of the piece, especially with reference to 
the limitations imposed by double or triple fretting (see, for instance,
 Michael Zapf&#8216;s analysis of Froberger for clavichord, given in 
Pfullingen 2003, and Darryl Martin&#8217;s studies on intabulations of lute 
music)
</p><p>
&#8226;  A similarity in style to another more specific piece (e.g. an <i>affetuoso</i> sonata by C. P. E. Bach similar to one that also contains a definitive indicator, such as the use of <i>Bebung</i>)

</p><p>
&#8226; Documentary evidence of instruments associated with the source of the 
music (e.g. the references by Samuel Pepys to keyboard instruments built
 by John Hayward suitable for 17th century music, J. S. Bach&#8217;s inventory
 of home instruments, dedications such as C. P. E. Bach&#8217;s reference to 
his Silbermann clavichord, and the description of his use of this 
clavichord by Charles Burney).
</p><p>
&#8226; Physical evidence of instruments available in a specific country and 
contemporary with the music (principally museum collections)
</p><p>
&#8226; Documentary (including iconographic) evidence for the existence of 
contemporary instruments in a country which are no longer extant. (It 
is, however, worth observing that no single English lute survives from 
the period of the most extensive English repertoire for that instrument)

</p><p>
&#8226; Evidence from external (foreign) sources for performance practice (visitor&#8216;s diaries and letters etc.)

</p><p>
&#8226; Lastly, the possibility that no specific keyboard was either 
designated or imagined by composer; this category allows for the 
&#8216;feels-right&#8217; factor, despite there being little objective evidence for 
such use (e.g. lute music in transcription for the clavichord).</p>
