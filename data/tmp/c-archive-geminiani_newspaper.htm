As part of Christopher's ongoing role as General 
Editor of the Francesco Geminiani Opera Omnia, he has been collating 
references relating to Geminiani extracted from newspapers and 
periodicals published in Britain, France and Holland in 1700-1800.  This
 collection has been developed into a database available for viewing by 
the public.  <a href="http://newspapers.francescogeminiani.com/" target="_blank">Click here to explore.</a>

The database contains a host of interesting information relating to 
Geminiani:  items relating to concerts of his music; the publication and
 sale of his works; and the sale of his own collection of art-works.   
It even includes some real curiosities, such as a poem published in <i>The Daily Advertiser</i>
 by an admirer listed only as 'L', proclaiming of Geminiani: "How seldom
 Genius&#8217;s, like Thine, arise! When lent by Heaven, how greatly should we
 prize!".  One can also read about the grand Charles Clay musical clock 
known as The Temple of the Four Grand Monarchies of the World which 
played music by Geminiani, Handel and Corelli.

To navigate the database one can search by general text, opus, category,
 language, or alternatively browse the entire list chronologically.  Any
 comments and corrections would be greatly appreciated and can be sent 
to <span class="blat">hogwood</span>.

We hope that this database will be a valuable tool for all those 
involved in Geminiani research and will aid the ongoing publication of 
the complete works of Francesco Geminiani. With thanks to Jonathan 
Dwerryhouse for his design work, and the input of Ryan Mark, Peter 
Holman, Richard Maunder and Rudolf Rasch.</p>
