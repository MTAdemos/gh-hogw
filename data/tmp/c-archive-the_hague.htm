Less travelling means, on the whole, less food news. A recent two weeks 
in The Hague and Amsterdam really only produced one surprise, and one 
shock.
</p><p>
In the Hague, the good news was the Marc Smeets Restaurant, otherwise 
disguised as part of the Hotel Corona, which is one of the startlingly 
good chain now known throughout Europe as the <i>Jeunes Restaurateurs d&#8217;Europe</i>.
</p><p>
As the title suggests, they are well-trained pioneers who are trying to 
break the Michelin-grip of standard fine dining recommendations. In The 
Hague they did excellent dinners and fine sunny lunches (sitting outside
 close to the Parliament building) and were able to give good advice on 
food, suitable wines, weather forecasts and train times to Maastricht!
</p><p>
The major wine surprise was to be offered of all things a Dutch white 
wine, from a small producer near Maastricht &#8212; a Pinot Gris from 
Apostelhoeve, Louwberg. After trying it, we recommended it so 
enthusiastically to everyone else that before I had left The Hague their
 supplies had been exhausted.
</p><p>
Their food is &#8220;classic French with a tendency towards fusion&#8221; &#8212; and 
cutlery, crockery, olive oil, &#8216;character&#8217; breads and sea-salt elegantly 
presented to match. The dinner menu with their selection of unexpected 
wine choices is a delight and not outrageously expensive either.

In addition to consulting the free guides to all the establishments 
collected together as Jeunes Restaurateurs d&#8217;Europe, I would also 
recommend a fine series of small eating guides which cover Holland 
published (in English) as the IENS Independent Index (<a href="http://www.iens.nl/">www.iens.nl</a>)
 which really are independent and outspoken with it (&#8220;It is a matter of 
opinion whether the fish is always as fresh as it should be&#8221; &#8212; this when
 you are only metres from the sea; and &#8220;You&#8217;ll leave with a sore bottom 
from the hard edges on the wooden chairs&#8221;).
</p><p>
The disappointment was a visit to a small restaurant also in The Hague 
and much recommended by IENS, which turned out to be basically one small
 room with an open kitchen at the side. Very cosy and the food smelt 
good, excellent wine list &#8212; until four of the five tables suddenly lit 
up with cigars! Clearly there is no law against this in Holland, even 
when the kitchen is open to the smoke. But it did ruin what might have 
been a good meal if we had been able to taste it, and made me wonder 
when other countries will follow the lead of New York and Italy and put 
legislation in place to stop this anti-culinary menace.
</p><p>
(Incidentally, both these restaurants had background music; if only the <i>Pipe Down</i> campaign had continental influence)

 for this disappointment was the freshest possible fish lunch at a hotel
 restaurant in Italy the following week: the Hotel Miramare in 
Castiglione della Pescaia, just north of Grosseto. The name sounded good
 and it turned out to be exactly overlooking the beach, with a fine old 
style covered terrace (smokers outside only) and the local calamari, sea
 bass and shell food all brought in via the small harbour that is within
 sight of the dining tables.

Other than a fine brasserie dinner at The Wolsey in Piccadilly (too well
 written-up to need repeating here) that was it this month. Now off to 
try and make what the Sunday Times last week announced as &#8220;Cheat&#8217;s 
Pimms&#8221; &#8212; they gave a recipe with all the ingredients and claimed it 
tasted just like the real thing, only much cheaper; watch this space.</p>
