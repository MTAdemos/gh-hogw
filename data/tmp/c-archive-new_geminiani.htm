<img src="upload/geminiani.jpg" alt="geminiani.jpg" class="imgright" height="300" width="237">Although
 during his lifetime Geminiani’s work was considered to be equal to his 
teacher Corelli, it has since been largely overlooked.

<p>
To date there has been no attempt to create a complete critical edition 
of the composer’s music and writings. It is anticipated that all volumes
 of the Opera Omnia edition will available in both library volumes and 
practical performing versions by 2012, the 250th anniversary of 
Geminiani’s death.  The full Editorial Plan with the contents of all 
sixteen volumes is now included on the project website.
