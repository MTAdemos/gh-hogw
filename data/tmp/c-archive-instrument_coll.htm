A check-list of Christopher&#8217;s collection of early keyboard instruments has been added to the web site 
(<a href="instruments.htm">click here</a>) and photos will follow soon. 

</p><p>
One of the most gratifying aspects of such a collection is the 
opportunity it gives makers not only for restoration but for copying the
 more important instruments and giving them a second life. This has 
happened in the past with several replicas of the Bodechtel and Hass 
clavichords now in use world-wide, and recently a copy of the small 
German chamber-organ was made by Marcus Stahl, who was responsible for 
the renovation of the original in 1996 while working for the organ 
builders Goetze and Gwynn. He has now built a copy of this organ and you
 can hear it being played at <a href="http://youtu.be/3c5grOUgMhQ">YouTube.</a>
