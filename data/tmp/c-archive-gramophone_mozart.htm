It&#8217;s difficult to think of many recordings of Mozart&#8217;s church music that
 so happily capture its character &#8211; the particular mixture of 
confidence, jubilation and contemplation &#8211; as Hogwood&#8217;s. His unfussy 
direction, broad phrasing, lively but generally unhurried tempi and 
happy details of timing serve splendidly in the Coronation Mass, the 
finest of Mozart&#8217;s completed Mass settings; the solemnity of the Kyrie, 
the fine swing of the Gloria and the energy of the Credo, with due pause
 for its rapt moment at the &#8216;Et incarnatus&#8217;, all these come over 
effectively. Arguably the &#8216;Osanna&#8217; is rather quick, but its jubilation 
is splendid. And the sweetness of the Benedictus is ravishing.

Not more so, however, than the Agnus, for there, at a decidedly slow 
tempo, Hogwood allows Emma Kirkby to make the most of this very sensuous
 music, which she duly most beautifully does. The soloists are 
altogether an excellent team, with two refined voices in the middle and 
Michael George a firm and sturdy bass. The inclusion of the K278 Epistle
 Sonata is a happy notion. The Vesperae solennes de confessore is a 
setting of the five Vesper psalms and the Magnificat, made in 1780, a 
year after the Mass, for some church feast in Salzburg. With admirable 
singing from the choir and a spacious recording with exceptionally good 
stereo separation that properly conveys the ecclesiastical ambience, 
this is a disc to treasure.
