<b><i>Essays in Honor of Christopher Hogwood: The Maestro's
Direction</i></b>  
Edited by Thomas Donahue, The Scarecrow Press, Inc. Lanham, Maryland, 2011, xvii + 259 pp, &#163;34.95, ISBN 978 0 8108 7737 5.

The <i>Festschrift</i> format consisting of essays by prominent scholars
 is an increasingly popular vehicle in academic publishing, though the 
nature of the particular <i>Fest</i> is not always immediately apparent. But judging from the Hogwood
Chronology in the introductory matter, I think this volume must mark Christopher Hogwood's 70th Birthday.
</p><p>
Hogwood's achievement is both wide-ranging and of considerable depth. 
This presents any editor with a difficult task in choosing contributions
 genuinely reflecting the interests of one of the leading scholars and 
performers of our day. Should he deal with one field in depth, or with 
all of them, accepting that the treatment of some fields will be less 
than optimal? Thomas Donahue has gone for the first approach, since of 
the eleven essays, six deal with aspects of keyboard organology (and 
four are focussed on the clavichord) while the other five sit somewhere 
between performance practice and the editing of music, but with heavy 
emphasis on the keyboard repertoire. That is understandable, since 
Hogwood started his musical career some years ago as a keyboard player. 
He has an extensive collection of early keyboard instruments, and is a 
distinguished ambassador for the clavichord and a persuasive performer 
on it, as an hour spent listening to <i>The Secret Bach</i> or one of his parallel CDs of Handel and Mozart will show.
</p><p>
Some of the contributors are acknowledged scholars, there is one essay 
from a young PhD student, and two from seasoned performers whose 
profiles and abilities match those of Hogwood himself. The book is 
nicely produced in hard covers and is fully illustrated, although only 
in monochrome, on which point I must add a note of disappointment - the 
opportunity exists now to link a book with a website giving access to 
high-resolution illustrations in full colour and it is a pity that has 
not been done, although of course, it is still not too late.
</p><p>
This book will be of primary interest to keyboard players and to 
keyboard organologists in particular; indeed for serious scholars of 
that subject it is a 'must buy'.
