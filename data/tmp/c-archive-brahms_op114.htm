Brahms&#8217;s Clarinet Trio, composed in 1891, was inspired by the exceptional 
musicality of clarinettist Richard M&#252;hlfeld. As he did for his horn 
trio, Brahms prepared a viola part as a possible alternative to the 
clarinet. Both scorings were rehearsed (the viola part being played by 
Joseph Joachim) prior to the premiere and publication of the work.
</p><p>
B&#228;renreiter&#8217;s scholarly-critical edition, prepared by Christopher, 
offers a foreword on the trio&#8217;s compositional process with comments on 
performance 
practice, as well as a comprehensive critical commentary and facsimile 
excerpts of the manuscript.  The viola part is included as an 
alternative to the clarinet part.</p>
