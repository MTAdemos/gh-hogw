November saw the publication of <i>The Cambridge Handel Encyclopedia</i>
 edited by Annette Landgraf and David Vickers. This is the first 
resource to gather the full range of present knowledge and leading new 
scholarship into a single volume for convenient and illuminating 
reference. It contains 716 entries written by 88 international scholars,
 and Christopher was called upon to contribute the entry on 
<i>Music for the Royal Fireworks</i>, and to write the Foreword, the full text of which is below.

We
 are told that Beethoven pointed at his Arnold edition of Handel and 
declared &#8216;Handel is the greatest and most capable composer; from him I 
can still learn&#8217;. Today we seem to have lost the art of praising Handel;
 even our most ardent Handelian anoraks find it difficult to applaud 
their hero in the sort of terms that for earlier generations were second
 nature. Faced with The Apotheosis of Handel &#8212; that familiar 1787 
engraving with the laurel wreath, the supporting angels, the upturned 
eyes &#8212; we simply blush and turn to the critical notes, hoping they will 
let us off the hook.

During his lifetime Handel was subjected to extremes of both reverence 
and dismissal&#8212; from Goupy&#8217;s caricature of the glutton seated at the 
organ, to Roubiliac&#8217;s sculpture of the great composer which took its 
place in Vauxhall Gardens alongside Homer and Milton (all three blind). 
But Roubiliac immortalised Handel in a remarkably informal pose, 
relaxed, wearing slippers and free from his wig, as a reminder that, 
though larger than life, he was still living and, though unique, very 
human.

Who cou&#8217;d like Handel with such art controul<br>
The various passions of the warring soul?<br>
With sounds each intellectual storm assuage,<br>
Fire us with holy rapture, or with rage?<br>
</p><p>
This question, posed by an anonymous poet writing On the Death of Mr 
Handel in 1759, was very specifically musical in its praise. A century 
later the eulogies had become much more generic, more moral than 
musical:
</p><p style="padding-left:30px; padding-right:30px;">
this was a man who had done honour to music as much by the nobility of 
his character as by the sublimity of his genius. He was one of the too 
few artists who uphold the dignity of art to the highest possible 
standard. He was the incarnation of honesty. The unswerving rigidity of 
his conduct captivates even those who do not take him for a model. He 
worked ceaselessly for the improvement of others without ever feeling 
weary. He was virtuous and pure, proud and intrepid. His love of good 
was as unconquerable as his will. He died at his post, working to the 
last hour of his life. He has left behind him a luminous track and a 
noble example. 
</p><p>
This was the Rev. T. Hanley Ball speaking to the Wimbledon Village Club 
in 1864, whose Victorian superlatives would be more acceptable were we 
not so aware that they were often used not so much to praise the past, 
but to slay the present, and criticize (or at least minimize) the 
products of later writers. &#8220;The works of Haydn, Beethoven, Mozart, 
Mendelssohn, Spohr, and others &#8212; great masters &#8212; are performed, and they
 are admired, and justly so, but they have not the hold upon the taste 
and feelings (of Englishmen at least) that Handel has&#8220;, wrote Dean 
Ramsey in 1862, adding, in a pre-echo of Elvis-mania: &#8220;He is the 
greatest, and the favourite. He stands alone.&#8220; William Crotch agreed: 
&#8220;The choruses of Mozart and Beethoven are frequently magnificent, but 
seldom sublime&#8221;, and listening yet again to the opening of Zadok the 
Priest, it is hard to disagree that Handel stands highest.
</p><p>
These comments all come from a century whose essential listening 
experience was by and large limited to a smallish selection of Handel&#8217;s 
oratorios, a few instrumental concertos and his keyboard works. The more
 recent re-discovery of Handel&#8217;s operas during the twentieth century 
initially set the cause back through appearing to demonstrate that, as 
far as the modern theatre was concerned, they were archaic constructions
 that failed to hold water and needed drastic surgery and cosmetic 
changes before they could be presented. To a certain extent this opinion
 still survives, although some operations are nowadays more sympathetic 
to the patient than others. &#8220;Critical appraisal&#8220; may have faulted some 
of Handel&#8217;s librettos, just as &#8220;moral appraisal&#8221; had earlier been 
brought to bear on his liberal &#8220;borrowings&#8221; of musical material from 
others, both living and dead &#8212; with similarly negative conclusions &#8212; but
 our awareness of the breadth of Handel&#8217;s output is now greater than at 
any previous period, including his own lifetime.

</p><p>
	We are also more voluminously informed than ever before on every aspect
 of his work and life. My own passion for Handel&#8217;s music was first 
sparked by the sheer power of the product &#8212; rather like an encounter 
with a vintage 8-litre Bentley &#8212; immediately followed by a desire to see
 under the bonnet, and to admire, if not to understand, the source of 
this power. I thus have one foot in the &#8220;Handel is the greatest&#8221; camp 
and the other in the critical world of present-day scholarship. On 
Handel&#8217;s moral supremacy we are now allowed to be sceptical or 
noncommittal, but on the nuts-and-bolts approach to composing &#8212; at which
 he wins hands down &#8212; we are surrounded by eager and well-informed 
researchers, and almost overwhelmed with facts and theories demanding 
our attention. For me (and I hope for you) such a ready-reference volume
 as the present publication makes the perfect Baedeker.
