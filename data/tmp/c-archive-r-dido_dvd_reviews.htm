April's issue of <a href="http://www.gramophone.co.uk/">Gramophone Magazine</a> featured a review of the DVD of <i>Dido and Aeneas</i> which was released in October 2009. The live production had been described as 'an evening of exquisite sensual pleasure' (<i>The Telegraph</i>)
 and Richard Lawrence, who reviews the DVD in Gramophone, believes that 
this is &#8220;a Dido that works better on screen that it did on stage&#8221; owing 
to the film direction of Jonathan Haswell. He also writes that 
Christopher &#8220;conducts with sensitivity, the langorous &#8220;Thanks to these 
lonesome vales&#8221; being a high-point, and the musicians of OAE respond to 
his direction with a spring in the step&#8221;.

More recently, in June's issue of <a href="http://www.bbcmusicmagazine.com/review/purcell-dido-and-aeneas">BBC Music Magazine</a>
 it was written that "under Christopher Hogwood&#8217;s shapely musical 
direction the score engorges the amplitude of the Opera House without 
forgoing any illuminating period pertinence.".

The DVD of the second performance, <i>Acis and Galatea</i>, was released in March so both are now available on DVD and Blu-ray Disc and distributed by <a href="http://www.naxos.com/catalogue/item.asp?item_code=OA1018D">Naxos</a> and <a href="http://www.opusarte.com/pages/product.asp?ProductID=309">Opus Arte</a></p>
