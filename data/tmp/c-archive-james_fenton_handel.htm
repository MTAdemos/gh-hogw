In an article by James Fenton on changing fortunes in Handel operas, the following passage noted the recent AAM performance of <i>Flavio</i> at the Barbican:
</p><p>
'As for the operas, matters were even worse. The operas were dead. 
"Occasional attempts at revival, although revealing untold glories to 
musicians of sober and patient tastes, have only shown that there is no 
hope of ever restoring these works to a stage which no longer resorts to
 extravagant sumptuousness of production for its own sake, nor has any 
use for the stiff formality of endless successions of da capo arias."
</p><p>
Handel's fortune really was at its nadir when his supporters, not his 
detractors, spoke in this way. Blom goes on: "The fact is that Handel's 
operas are merely so many secular oratorios in costume, on the whole 
less dramatic than the oratorios themselves because they lack the choral
 climaxes, and that we might as well think of building flats and 
factories in the baroque manner as of putting them on stage again except
 occasionally and experimentally."
</p><p>
I was thinking of this passage during Christopher Hogwood's concert 
performance of Handel's Flavio, re de'Langobardi at the Barbican a few 
days ago. A succession, yes, although not an endless succession, of 
arias; a plot that was of no great concern to the audience; rather 
little recitative; but a fluent and unhesitating progression through the
 score, which came over like a succession of demonstrations: this is 
what it is like to be angry, to feel vengeful, to be in love, to mourn, 
to be triumphant. It was like an unfolding essay in the emotions, acted 
out both through the singing voices and through the descriptive power of
 the orchestration.
</p><p>
The practice of concert performances of rare operas, with or without 
some element of acting, of semi-staging (in this case largely confined 
to some interaction between the singers, according to the demands of the
 script) - how simple it all seemed to achieve. How unproblematic. How 
impossible (it would appear) to predict in 1935.' <i>James Fenton</i>
