In
 1985 Christopher won the Brit Award for Best Classical Recording for 
Vivaldi's Four Seasons with Academy of Ancient Music. The album was very
 successful, selling more copies in CD format than LP and cassette 
combined.
</p><p>
The main focus of the award was Christopher's academic approach and his 
intention to produce the most authentic sound possible. Interestingly, 
at the same ceremony was Sting, winning the award for Most Outstanding 
Contribution with The Police, who was very surprised that the recording 
could be so well received purely in virtue of the fact that it was 
authentic. Christopher writes on this topic in a forthcoming article, 
'Musical Identity' (to be published by Cambridge University Press in <i>Identity</i>, part of the Darwin College Lecture Series):
</p><p style="padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px;">
"From the graphic artist's viewpoint, all musical performances are, as 
it were, cover versions, since only Mozart playing Mozart could be the 
real thing. I well remember Sting, at a Brit Awards ceremony many years 
ago, being surprised, and possibly a little outraged that the Academy of
 Ancient Music had won a prize for simply playing Vivaldi 'as he would 
have played it' ('You didn't do anything to it?', he asked, 
incredulously); now, I am intrigued to see, he records Dowland."
