December brought the day of our Christmas lunch. Christopher&#8217;s employees
 and those of the Academy of Ancient Music joined together for a festive
 lunch on 8 December. Food and drink flowed a plenty and the festive 
mood was then set for the Christmas season. Two unusual suspects 
provided entertainment: a delightful puppy named Nutmeg (recently 
acquired by Charlotte Wadham, Christopher&#8217;s Manager), and a serpent of 
the musical variety, played by Chris Lawrence, General Manager of the 
Academy of Ancient Music.

Anita Codling and Lotte Attwood were busy providing excellent food. We 
enjoyed cooked ham with vegetables (including peas in cream with lettuce
 and spring onion &#8212; requested by the Academy of Ancient Music!). We then
 enjoyed delicious Cornish Yarg cheese, as well as other favourites. For
 pudding, there was a choice of Key Lime Pie, red fruits with vanilla 
ice cream, white chocolate and mascarpone tart with blueberries and 
redcurrants, and mince pies.
