In 1998, to mark their 25th anniversary, the modern-day Academy of Ancient Music published a facsimile edition of Hawkins&#8217; <i>An account of the institution and progress of the Academy of Ancient Music</i>,
 which was first published in 1770, and tells part of the story of the 
eighteenth-century ensemble from whom they take their name.
</p><p>
Here is Christopher&#8217;s preface to that volume. 
</p><p>
This is the history of a club, written by the man for whom his friend 
Samuel Johnson coined the word &#8216;unclubbable&#8217;. John Hawkins (Sir John 
from 1772) was not a naturally lovable character, any more than Johnson 
was naturally musical; few of his acquaintances could summon up many 
words of praise for his manner, and his professional enemies (of whom 
the rival music historian Charles Burney was the most pungent) verged on
 the apoplectic. Although Hawkins was both his friend and executor, the 
best Johnson himself could manage was : &#8216;As to Sir John, why really I 
believe him to be an honest man at the bottom: but to be sure he is 
penurious, and he is mean, and it must be owned that he has a degree of 
brutality, and a tendency to savageness, that cannot easily be 
defended&#8217;. True to this description, Hawkins seems to have undertaken 
his executorial duties with a zeal that is almost callous: hardly was 
the Doctor dead but &#8216;during the time the surgeon was engaged in opening 
his body, Sir John Hawkins, Knight, was in the adjoining room seeing to 
the weighing of the Doctor&#8217;s teapot, in the presence of a silversmith, 
whom Sir John, as an executor, had called in to purchase it&#8217; (reported 
by the gossipy John Thomas Smith of the British Museum in <i>A Book for a Rainy Day: or Recollections of the events of the last sixty-six years</i>.
 published in 1845). Other contemporaries mentioned &#8216;malignancy&#8217;, 
described him as &#8216;mean and grovelling&#8217; and &#8216;detestable&#8217;, while Burney, 
who organised a covert campaign against Hawkins&#8217; <i>General History of Music</i>
 (and in favour of his own publication which was appearing 
simultaneously in 1776), dubbed him the &#8216;Knight of the Freezing Quarto&#8217;.
</p><p>
These two histories, the first of their kind, examined the most pressing
 question of the day: the identification of excellence in musical style,
 and the study of how music had arrived at its present state. To Burney,
 the modern style was the peak to which the art had long been 
struggling, and Italian opera its proudest ensign. Hawkins, on the other
 hand, declared a preference for &#8216;the old school&#8217;, the contrapuntalists 
of the 17th century, their madrigals, motets and masses, and found 
contemporary music &#8216;most unnatural and absurd... noise without harmony&#8217;.
 Burney travelled Europe to discover foreign views and repertoire (which
 he recorded with elegance and wit), while Hawkins trawled though the 
libraries and collections of England with erudition and discernment but,
 sadly, no sense of humour and with a lawyer&#8217;s dignity of style (he was 
later described as &#8216;the best magistrate in the Kingdom&#8217;). But Hawkins, 
despite Johnson&#8217;s critique, was far from anti-social; he was one of the 
first and longest-lasting members of the Johnson circle, he was elected 
to the Ivy Lane Club, he hobnobbed with Garrick, Reynolds, Goldsmith and
 Horace Walpole and sang with the Madrigal Society. For his first 
literary effort he collected details first-hand from Handel sufficient 
to write a biography of Steffani, and followed it (as an enthusiastic 
fly-fisherman) with a new edition of Walton&#8217;s <i>Compleat Angler</i>. As
 a public-spirited lawyer, he presented several pamphlets on legal 
cases, offered &#8216;Observations on the State of the Highways and on the 
Laws for amending and keeping them in repair&#8217;, but could still sneer at 
the contemporary increase in social conscience &#8212; &#8216;We live in an age when
 humanity is in fashion&#8217;.
</p><p>
His prime interest and constant love, however, was the study of music, 
and his preferences and the musical club that shared them (the infant 
Academy of Ancient Music) were described by his daughter L&#230;titia-Matilda
 in her rambling Anecdotes, <i>Biographical Sketches and Memoirs</i> of 1822.
</p><p>
My father&#8217;s musical taste confirmed itself almost exclusively to the 
compositions of what is now termed the old school: he had known all the 
great composers in that style, from his earliest youth; and Geminiani 
and his contemporaries being dead, I found him, when, if I may be 
allowed the ludicrous expression,<i> I took him up</i>, in intimacy with
 Cooke and Boyce, Dr. Howard, and the corps that formed the 
Crown-and-Anchor concert in its primitive simplicity. For the prosperity
 of this choice concert, he was particularly anxious; and when it was 
declining under the influence of what he thought a worse taste, he wrote
 an elegant pamphlet in its favour, in hopes of prolonging its 
existence; but its death-blow had already been given it.
It had been held in the then sufficiently capacious and humbly-decorated
 best room of the tavern, and ladies tolerated as auditors, only by 
submitting to sit in a small passage-room, made warm and comfortable, 
but certainly no show-shop for themselves or their finery; &#8212; this 
restriction to a confined spot was not felt grievous by those who loved 
such music and only came to hear. As it was an <i>amateur-society</i>, 
the husbands and fathers of many of them were in the orchestra; and for 
many years no discontent was expressed: &#8212; but at length gentlemen who 
mistook their love for <i>hearing a tune</i> for a taste for music, 
began to grumble at the exclusion of those of their families who perhaps
 fostered this taste; and thinking it unfair that persons with at least 
equal pretensions, should not enjoy privileges allowed to themselves, 
they stickled for an extension of indulgence. One <i>public night</i>, 
as it was called, was therefore proposed as an annual festival in the 
spring, when the ladies should be admitted to the great room and 
accommodated; &#8212; this was an accepted compromise, and the concert 
flourished. Its fame now extended itself: that wonderful musical genius,
 Joah Bates, became a member and no idle one; Lord Sandwich added his 
name, and was very punctual in his attendance with his kettle-drums. 
Lord Mornington followed, and if I am not mistaken, Lord Rochford, then 
secretary of state. These persons joined in paying that professional 
respect which Dr. Cooke, who was librarian and one of the most active of
 the members, always attracted: &#8212; convivial suppers were established; 
late hours were introduced; and the good-natured Doctor, to whose organs
 a negative was very difficult of pronunciation, &#8212; when asked by 
enthusiastic amateurs for copies of manuscripts, too readily answered in
 his usual manner, &#8216;O! yes, yes, my boys will copy it out.&#8217; Having been 
once prevailed on to do what there was no law or rule against his doing,
 he was soon taunted into similar compliances. My father saw it, and 
prophesied the event, but with the fate generally attendant on 
prophecies of what is unpleasant. A rival concert, where ladies were 
admitted and female singers hired to perform, was set up at the 
Freemasons&#8217; Tavern; and that lasted till arrangements could be made for 
what is now called &#8216;The Ancient-Music Concert,&#8217; &#8212; the parent-concert 
having been then some years deceased. &#8212; With it died my father&#8217;s concern
 in what had at one time so deeply interested him; he looked on the new 
institution with a jealous dislike, which made the mention of it a 
matter of delicate forbearance in his family. [Vol. I, pp. 225-227]
</p><p>
Such, then, was the rise and fall of the Academy of Antient Music. Many 
versions of its history have arisen, and much confusion between its 
activities and those of the Concert of Ancient Music, and other 
symbiotic organisations. L&#230;titia&#8217;s explanation sheds new light on both 
the development and the disintegration of &#8216;that parent society to which 
the most gratifying of all the concerts of the metropolis owes its 
existence&#8217;, and accurately paints the transition in London musical life 
from what was essentially a private gentlemen&#8217;s club (&#8216;convivial 
suppers&#8217;, &#8216;late hours&#8217;) to an openly commercial musical entertainment 
run by and with professionals for the delight of both sexes. Her 
father&#8217;s pamphlet, describing what he knew of the history of the Academy
 and defending its (and his own) preferences for &#8216;the best music of the 
best times&#8217;, was a vain attempt to rally support for the &#8216;primitive&#8217; 
(i.e. original) institution: &#8216;To prevent the dissolution of this 
primitive establishment Sir J. H. printed and liberally distributed what
 he entitled An Account of the Academy of Antient Music.&#8217; Since it was a
 private publication and distributed in person, no author was mentioned 
on the title-page; but there was never any intention (or indeed, hope) 
of anonymity.
</p><p>
Hawkins was aware of an initial problem with the Academy, &#8216;the 
prejudices which its very name...may excite&#8217;, and expects no support 
from those &#8216;who think no music can be good which is not new&#8217;. His 
objections to this modern music are less coherent &#8212; it is mostly written
 in a major key and on a &#8216;monotonic bass&#8217;.
</p><p>
Other opponents of the Academy attacked it for an antiquarianism which 
in fact its programmes did not demonstrate: sacred music from the 
sixteenth century (a regular feature of all their concerts) and English 
madrigals were balanced by Purcell, Handel and Pergolesi. But even in 
1734 the unknown author of <i>Harmony in an Uproar</i>, a satire addressed to Handel, could ridicule them as still
shrinking from his music:

</p><p style="padding-left:24px; padding-right:24px;">
As for that indefatigable Society, the Gropers into Antique Musick, and 
Hummers of Madrigals, they swoon at the Sight of any Piece modern, 
particularly of your Composition, excepting the performances of their 
venerable President [Dr. Pepusch], whose Works bear such vast 
Resemblance to the regular Gravity of the Antients, that when dress&#8217;d up
 in Cobwebs, and powdered with Dust, the Philharmonick Spiders could 
dwell on them, and in them, to Eternity.
</p><p>
The members of the Academy had, two years before Hawkins&#8217; pamphlet, 
produced their own manifesto in the course of an internal scandal 
(Bononcini was discovered to have passed off a madrigal by Lotti as his 
own); the work of the Academy, they asserted in a series of letters to 
Lotti, was the &#8216;searching after, examining, and hearing performed the 
Works of the Masters, who flourished before and about the Age of 
Palestrina: however, not neglecting those who in our Time have become 
famous&#8217;. There was no belief in that idea of constant progress to which 
Burney was so partial, nor the supremacy of all things Italian; their 
repertoire regularly included works by Tallis and Byrd and (they pointed
 out to Lotti in Venice) &#8216;when you cast your eye upon those Pieces, you 
will clearly perceive that true and solid Musick is not in its Infancy 
with us, and that, whatever some on your Side of the Alps may imagine to
 the Contrary, the Muses have of old time taken up their Abode in 
England&#8217;.
</p><p>
The Academy had begun in 1726 as a form of private club, largely 
supported by the &#8216;singing-men&#8217; of St Paul&#8217;s, Westminster and the Chapel 
Royal, and with the title &#8216;Academy of Vocal Music&#8217;. Sampson Estwick, who
 attended its very first session, described &#8216;A Musick Meeting being held
 at ye Crown Tavern near St Clement&#8217;s Mr Galliard at ye head of it , 
&amp; cheifly for Grave ancient vocell Musick. Wee begann it wth ye 
following Song of Lucas de Marenzio Jan 7&#8212;1725/6.&#8217;1 (The madrigal was 
&#8216;Dolorosi martir&#8217;from 1580; Morley, Stradella and Steffani were also 
named).
</p><p>
The title was changed from &#8216;Vocal&#8217; to &#8216;Ancient&#8217; (we might today prefer 
&#8216;classical&#8217;) in 1731, and Johann Christoph Pepusch, who had been a 
member for some years, was given charge of both repertoire and 
performers. The number of instrumental players increased, at first to 
accompany the extracts from Purcell&#8217;s theatre music (<i>Timon of Athens</i> and <i>The Indian Queen</i>
 were favourites) and later the sequence of Handel&#8217;s music, which began 
with the ground-breaking performance of Esther in 1732 that Hawkins 
describes, and later took in <i>Israel in Egypt</i>, <i>Messiah</i>, the 
<i>Funeral Music for Queen Caroline</i> and settings of the <i>Te Deum</i>.
</p><p>
From Hawkins&#8217; account it is clear that Pepusch also saw the Academy as 
having an educational obligation in the training of young musicians; 
William Boyce, Samuel Howard, James Nares, John Travers and the 
compliant Benjamin Cooke all came from this stable. Essential to the 
plan was the establishment of a substantial library, and several major 
collections now in the British Library originated with members of the 
Academy. Considerable parts of Pepusch&#8217;s famous library (which included <i>The Fitzwilliam Virginal Book</i>)
 were left to the Academy; Henry Needler, famous for having lead the 
first performance of Corelli&#8217;s concertos in England&#8212; when the company 
were so entranced that (according to Hawkins) they played the entire set
 of twelve concerti &#8216;without rising from their seats&#8217; &#8212; left a series of
 27 volumes of manuscript music (16th century Italian to Handel), while 
Benjamin Cooke, who became organist of Westminster Abbey, is represented
 by 33 volumes with a range of repertoire from the Fayrfax Manuscript 
through John Bull, and Corelli to J. S. Bach (including parts of <i>The Art of Fugue</i>) and Scarlatti.
</p><p>
Some idea of both the breadth and the shift in repertoire that the 
Academy accommodated during more than sixty seasons can be drawn from 
the following contrasting programmes:

This last concert, for which John Peter Salomon was leading the 
orchestra, took place in the year of Mozart&#8217;s death and while Haydn was 
in London. Such lack of support for &#8216;those of our time who have become 
famous&#8217;&#8212; a clear dereliction of their earlier claims &#8212; will surely have 
set many of the public against the Academy&#8217;s activities, while others 
were publicly distressed at the promiscuous mixing of sacred and 
secular. An anonymous diatribe titled &#8216;The Prostitution of Lent&#8217; 
appeared in the Monthly Mirror (I, 1795-6):

</p><p style="padding-left:24px; padding-right:24px;">
Imagination can scarcely conceive any thing more abominably impious, 
than the melange which is usually dignified with the appellation of 
SACRED MUSIC....At one time the audience is presented with, &#8216;I know that
 my redeemer liveth,&#8217; and at another with the wandering transitions of a
 female maniac &#8212; with &#8216;Pious Orgies,&#8217; and the &#8216;Soldier tir&#8217;d&#8217; &#8212; &#8216;Holy, 
Holy Lord God Almighty,&#8217; and &#8216;Mirth admit me of thy Crew&#8217; &#8212; &#8216;Lord of 
Eternity,&#8217; and &#8216;Hush ye pretty warbling choir&#8217; &#8212; &#8216;Hallelujah&#8217; and &#8216;The 
Prince unable;&#8217; &#8212; thus are the public alternately amused with a 
celebration of Omnipotence, and a song of amorous dalliance; the 
attributes of the Deity, and a Bacchanalian rhapsody; Te Deum and 
L&#8217;Allegro; the suffering of the MESSIAH, and the ravings of <i>mad Bess</i>.
</p><p>
Clearly, contrast in content was not attractive to this critic. But a 
more substantial complaint was raised against the programming of a 
&#8216;Grand Miscellaneous Selection&#8217;:
</p><p style="padding-left:24px; padding-right:24px;">
...it is undoubtably with a view to relieve the languor of the audience,
 that, for some years past, the managers of our oratorios have, instead 
of one whole work of our immortal Handel, presented detached parts or 
selections, with an intermixture of instrumental music, and such 
novelties as may attract and preserve the attention. [Anon &#8216;The Gleaner&#8217;
 Universal Magazine, CVIII, 1801]
The cry of pandering to public taste and limited attention span rings 
very familiar today, but in the case of the Academy it was more a case 
of the formula having outgrown its members. John Marsh pointed out that,
 ever since the division of taste into &#8216;the old school&#8217; and &#8216;the 
moderns&#8217;, it had become &#8216;the fashion of musical amateurs to attach 
themselves to one of the two styles, and to reprobate the other. Elderly
 people in general prefer, as is natural enough, the style they have 
been used to, and complain of the inferiority of the present basses to 
those of the ancient composers, as well as the want of fugue and labored
 contrivance in modern pieces&#8217;. He concludes, reasonably enough, that 
&#8216;the principal supporters therefore of the ancient style being elderly 
people, and of course gradually dropping off, it is probable that... 
that species of music would have dropt altogether&#8217;. But old music was 
rescued by the success of the great Handel Commemoration in 1784, which,
 with wholehearted royal support, confirmed Handel as the national 
classic. As for new music, Marsh claims, only the long-awaited arrival 
of Haydn prevented the modern manner from &#8216;degenerating into a light, 
trivial and uniform character&#8217;.
</p><p>
It seems inevitable that the Academy should therefore have ceased about 
this time, despite the efforts of its last conductor, the great 
Handelian, Samuel Arnold. It gave way to the public concert series, the 
professional symphony orchestra, the music of the pleasure gardens and 
the opera house. But it had achieved a small musical revolution: it had 
established for the first time that music of the church and music of the
 theatre could be performed apart from their original settings, and by 
selecting and performing old music on a regular basis, it laid the 
foundations for a new (and English) concept of a &#8216;canon of classics&#8217; 
which the wider public has embraced ever since. As a private club, it 
could not itself dictate public taste, but its activities paved the way 
for a concert scene containing the accepted medley of old and new that 
we know today.
</p><p>
Hawkins&#8217; rhetoric is in no way wasted on the principles he presents with
 such dedication, and the present Academy of Ancient Music is happy to 
echo his motto.
