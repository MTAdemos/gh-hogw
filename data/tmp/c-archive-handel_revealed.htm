Central to this year's celebrations of the 250th anniversary of Handel's death is <i>Handel Reveal'd</i>,
 an exhibition now open at Handel House Museum which aims to elucidate 
the composer's character. Christopher, already a performer, editor and 
biographer of Handel, has curated the exhibition:

</p><p>
"I thought in this anniversary year 'celebrating' his death it would be 
nice to ask questions like 'what did he die of?', 'how did he live?', 
'what about his love life?'.
</p><p>
"Handel was a terribly private person and clearly thought that the 
public had no right to know what happened in his house once he had 
closed the door.
</p><p>
"When you try to piece together the facts of his life it is sort of 
opposite to Mozart, who was a very open figure. There are terrible gaps 
[in our knowledge] and periods when we don't even know where Handel was.
</p><p>
"This major anniversary gives us the opportunity of presenting 'Handel 
the man', something which is rarely done. It is a true delight to be 
able to do so in the very rooms in which Handel lived and created the 
music that brought him international fame. The House is imbued with the 
atmosphere of Georgian London society, in which Handel was a commanding 
presence. So many episodes in Handel's life happened at 25 Brook Street 
and, of course, he died here 250 years ago."

was
previewed by the press with morbid curiosity:

Of course, this anniversary provides the platform for revealing not only
 Handel's character but also some unwarrantably under-performed works. 
As Christopher reminded us earlier this year, in 
<!-- <a href="http://www.hogwood.org/news/in-celebration-of-handel-and-purcell.html"> --> <!-- dead link -->
NEMA's 2009 <i>Yearbook</i><!--</a>-->,
 it is time, for example, to 'rescue that other great arena of dramatic 
and virtuoso vocal music, the private cantata, which the young Handel 
delivered so flamboyantly, and the older Handel borrowed from so 
regularly.' 
</p><p>
It also remains for the public to re-evaluate Handel's operas, which 
have suffered at the hands of those practitioners who have compensated 
for their misunderstanding of the music by seeking to apologise for it 
with extraneous nudity and violence. In his continuing drive to prove 
the greatness of the operas, Christopher conducts <i>Arianna</i> in May, and is joined by AAM, with whom he performed
<i>Amadigi</i> in 2007 and <i>Flavio</i> in 2008. Christopher's <i>Acis and Galatea</i> was recently very well-received at the 
<!-- <a href="http://www.hogwood.org/news/dido-and-acis-first-night.html"> --> <!-- dead link -->
Royal Opera House<!--</a>-->.

</p><p>
Not currently on the horizon for Christopher is <i>Messiah</i>, the work chosen for the anniversary concert at Westminster Abbey. With 300 performances to his credit, he recently told <a href="http://www.thetablet.co.uk/"><i>The Tablet</i></a>
 (April 11) 'it's a pity' for, while it is still 'a superb piece, 
musically and dramatically', it remains 'over-featured, when the public,
 especially the British public, has a right to choose from 42 operas, 29
 oratorios, or &#8211; most-neglected of all &#8211; more than 120 cantatas.'
