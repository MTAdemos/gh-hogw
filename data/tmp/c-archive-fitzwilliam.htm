<b>The Fitzwilliam Museum:<br> 
as seen by Christopher Hogwood</b>
</p><p>
It has never seemed very sensible to me to treat musicology and music 
performance as separate &#8212; or even conflicting &#8212; areas of study; surely 
each is a part of the other.

</p><p>
When I first arrived in Cambridge in 1960, Thurston Dart was the prime 
and in those days lone advocate of pursuing both paths; he was keyboard 
player, orchestra director, musicologist, editor, writer, teacher and 
broadcaster &#8212; a fine and I thought very tempting mix. He was also blunt 
in his criticisms; seeing me in the street clutching a newly-purchased 
copy of the standard edition of the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, he 
stopped me to point out that I had paid for &#8216;twenty errors on every 
page!&#8217;. He may have been exaggerating, but his proposed cure was most 
effective: &#8216;My dear sir, go to the Museum down the road and look at the 
real thing&#8217;. 
</p><p>
One of the revelations of entering the Fitzwilliam Museum (in addition 
to the rare treat of it being air-conditioned in summer) was the unique 
combination of artefacts it displayed: paintings together with 
furniture, ceramics with carpets, frightening armour alongside fragile 
glass, Beethoven&#8217;s watch facing Handel&#8217;s bookcase. 
</p><p>
The musical holdings of the library are still one of Cambridge&#8217;s 
best-kept secrets, but for the keyboard player, pride of place must go 
to the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, bequeathed by Viscount Fitzwilliam to 
the University of Cambridge in 1816. The largest single source of a very
 English repertoire, this elegant manuscript contains nearly 300 pieces,
 including a large part of the output of John Bull, William Byrd, Giles 
Farnaby and Peter Philips. 
</p><p>
But there is a special insight provided when this manuscript is on 
display next to the Museum&#8217;s two historical keyboards: a spinetta a 
tavola or virginal built in Italy in the late sixteenth or early 
seventeenth century (and thus contemporary with the Virginal Book) and 
an anonymous Florentine harpsichord from about 1680 (which once belonged
 to the Italian tragedienne Eleanora Dusa). The harpsichord was restored
 to playing condition in 1975 and I had the chance to include it on a 
recording of music from the Virginal Book, thus putting the 
musicological and the practical together in harness. 
</p><p>
And those &#8216;twenty errors on every page&#8217;? My present project is the 
re-editing for Musica Britannica of all the material in the Virginal 
Book which has not so far appeared in scholarly modern editions, 
trusting that by doing so I will manage to appease the ghost of Thurston
 Dart.</p>
