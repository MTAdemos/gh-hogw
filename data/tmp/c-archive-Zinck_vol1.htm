The <i>Sechs Clavier-Sonaten</i> of 1783 by Hardenack 
Otto Conrad Zinck (1746-1832) were welcomed with great enthusiasm by 
contemporary critics and widely distributed among not only pianists but 
also the most noted proponents of the clavichord. These Sonatas, "spoken
 of in the same breath as the best by H&#228;ssler, T&#252;rk and others", 
comprise the first of three volumes of Zinck's complete keyboard music 
edited by Christopher for <a href="http://www.editionhh.co.uk/hh240cat.htm">Edition HH</a>.

A
student of C. P. E. Bach, Zinck was praised for his integrity: for 
emulating rather than imitating his teacher, and for avoiding the trend 
towards <i>ease</i> in performance that led many composers to saturate the market with "thin gruel". Of the <i>Sechs Clavier-Sonaten</i>, C. F. Cramer, in his <i>Magazin der Musik</i>,
 wrote, "Their interesting melodic style, highly developed turns of 
phrase, great diversity of musical ideas unified into one great sonata 
style far removed from the routine, and finally, very descriptive 
tone-painting, elevate them and make them worthy of the approval of 
connoisseurs".

Cramer chose to reprint in his review Zinck's own Preface, and both 
texts are reproduced, in facsimile and translation, in Christopher's 
Introduction to the new edition. Also included are facsimiles of the 
original title-page, the list of 294 subscribers, and Zinck's 
Postscript, in which the composer sets out his reasons for favouring 
treble over soprano clef. Zinck's short list of Corrections, included 
with the original edition, have been incorporated in the Critical 
Commentary, and the Ode, <i>Kain am Ufer des Meeres</i>, which 
constitutes an alternative ending to the sixth Sonata, is printed with a
 translation of Friedrich Leopold Graf zu Stolberg's verses.</p>
