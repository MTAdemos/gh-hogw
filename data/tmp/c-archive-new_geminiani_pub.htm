The latest volume of the <a href="http://www.utorpheus.com/product_info.php?products_id=2628"><i>Francesco Geminiani Opera Omnia</i></a> has just been published by Ut Orpheus Edizioni, Bologna, containing both the <i>Rules for Playing in a True Taste Op. 8</i> (<i>c</i>1748) and <i>A Treatise of Good Taste in the Art of Musick</i>
 (1749) edited by Peter Walls. Christopher is the General Editor of the 
series, which presents all the works of Geminiani (1687-1762) in full 
critical editions, to celebrate this year&#8217;s 250th anniversary of the 
composer&#8217;s death.

The <i>Rules</i> and the <i>Treatise</i>
 were the first of several didactic works Geminiani published in the 
later stages of his career, his focus having shifted from writing music 
to writing <i>about</i> music. The musical contents of the <i>Rules</i> are four sets of variations on English, Scottish and Irish tunes, while the <i>Treatise</i> contains songs, sonatas, and airs based on melodies taken from the 1733 collection <i>Orpheus Caledonius</i>.
 Both publications were designed to guide singers and players of flute, 
violin, cello and harpsichord to perform with good taste, by the liberal
 use of marks of expression and ornamentation, introduced in Geminiani&#8217;s
 Preface to the <i>Rules</i> and expanded upon, with examples and realisations, in the <i>Treatise</i>. In turn, the matters raised in
 these publications were subsequently developed in <i>The Art of Playing on the Violin Op. 9</i> (1751) and <i>The Art of Accompaniment
 Op. 11</i> (<i>c</i>1756).</p>

In the new edition, Geminiani&#8217;s verbal and musical texts are newly 
typeset, allowing both for corrections derived from significant 
manuscript versions, and for his instructions to be read side-by-side 
with his music examples, which originally had to be engraved on separate
 pages. Geminiani&#8217;s material is supplemented by a new Introduction and a
 full Critical Commentary, as well as numerous facsimiles, including all
 the melodies and lyrics borrowed from <i>Orpheus Caledonius</i>.</p>
