As
 the foremost representative of Czech music in 18th-century Vienna, 
Leopold Ko&#382;eluch (1747&#8211;1818) was noted as a composer, pianist and 
keyboard teacher. His 50 keyboard sonatas cover his entire career and 
mark not only the transition from the harpsichord and clavichord manner 
to the fully idiomatic forte-piano style, but also the development of 
the &#8220;classical sonata&#8220; which spanned several decades (from 1773 to 
1809). 
</p><p>
Until now, pianists have had little chance to acquaint themselves with 
the complete range of Ko&#382;eluch&#8217;s sonatas since few existed in modern 
editions. For the first time this new complete edition by Christopher 
presents all sonatas for keyboard solo. Each volume includes a detailed 
introduction, a critical commentary and facsimiles.
</p><p>
Volume I of the Complete Sonatas for Keyboard has already generated a 
great deal of positive interest.  The German Clavichord Society recently
 reported that: "The edition is visually appealing and from a scholarly 
point of view well edited. It &#8211; and the following three volumes - 
deserve a wide circulation in interested circles!  A growing 
appreciation of Ko&#382;eluch is taking place and certainly offers a welcome 
diversification of the classical repertoire &#8211; also for modern pianists 
and their students".</p>
