 2005 was a continuous round of travel, rehearsing and giving concerts 
in Italy and Germany; however, some of the more relaxing moments have 
involved eating and drinking, and the finding of interesting, quiet and 
hospitable restaurants is part of the fun of being a travelling 
musician.
</p><p>
For the benefit of any other travellers who happen to be in these cities
 and would be interested in the details of establishments that will 
deliver good food after the end of a concert, here are some new 
discoveries.
</p><p>
<b>Firenze</b><br>
Almost opposite the stage door of the Teatro Verdi is the
</p><p>
Osteria del Caff&#233; Italiano<br>
via Isola delle Stinche 11/13r<br>
50122 Firenze<br>
tel: 055 289368
</p><p>
Good Florentine food, big wine list, lunches, even omelettes (closed Mondays)
</p><p>
Further down the same street (turn left) is a family restaurant much 
frequented by members of the Orchestra della Toscana (complete lunch can
 be a little as &#8364;5.50):
</p><p>
Trattoria Pallottino<br>
via Isola delle Stinche 1/r<br>
tel: 055 289573
</p><p>
New-style &#8216;fusion&#8217; cooking with a very grand wine list available by the glass at
</p><p>
<img class="imgright" src="upload/gustavino.jpg">
Gustavino restaurant<br>
Gustavino<br>
Enoteca con Cucina<br>
via della Condotta 37r<br>
tel: 055 2399806<br>
<a href="http://www.gustavino.it/">www.gustavino.it</a>

</p><p>
The decor is modern steel and glass in an old building close to the 
Duomo, but with an attached &#8216;old-style&#8217; bar for snacks and wine tasting.
 They also sell an ingenious wine-saver &#8212; powered by a gas capsule and 
delivering single glasses from an open bottle which is then sealed with 
inert gas (great if you have serious intentions of not finishing the 
bottle)
</p><p>
<b>Milano</b><br>
First call should be the vast food and wine shop Peck (via Spadari, very
 close to the piazza Duomo): thousands of cheeses, hams, sausages, 
coffee beans, jams, olive oils, jereboams of P&#233;trus, a tea shop and 
lunch stop, splendid bar for a mid-morning prosecco and newspapers, 
chocolates and fine breads (some even salted): probably the equal of 
Fortnum &amp; Mason in Italy, but more familiar.
</p><p>
For central (near Duomo) eating there is the Ristorante Galleria (just 
inside the Galleria, on the right) which delivers the best 
&#8216;people-watching&#8217; in Milan &#8212; a constant flow of all types (specially 
fashion victims) outside the glass windows, and quick one-course lunches
 (e.g. traditional ossabucco). Leave the Galleria at the other end and 
turn right for
</p><p>
<img class="imgright" src="upload/papafrancesco.jpg">
Ristorante Pap&#224; Francesco<br>
via Marino 7<br>
tel: 02 862 177<br>
<a href="http://www.papafrancesco.com/">www.papafrancesco.com</a>
</p><p>
Another family restaurant very well-placed for after-opera audiences 
from La Scala (once the theatre has really re-opened); a picture of the 
maestro dining is apparently now on their website.
</p><p>
Al Cantinone<br>
via Agnello 19<br>
tel: 02 365 34651
</p><p>
stays open late (also near the Duomo) and served an unusual pasta form (new to me, at least) called Gramigna
</p><p>
The concert hall for the Orchestra Sinfonica di Milano Giuseppe Verdi is
 a little south of the Porta Ticinese (Auditorium di Milano, a converted
 cinema with a very superior acoustic). The nearby lunch-time restaurant
 can be warmly recommended &#8212; it describes itself as &#8220;Vineria con piccola
 cucina&#8221;:
</p><p>
<img class="imgright" src="upload/viola.jpg">
Viola<br>
via Pavia 6/2<br>
tel: 02 8942 1529<br>
<a href="http://www.violaenoteca.it/">www.violaenoteca.it</a>
</p><p>
Opposite the stage door of the Auditorium is a tempting shop creatively called &#8220;Wine Not?&#8221; (in English moreover...)
</p><p>
Near the church of San Lorenzo (on the way back towards the centre) a 
very welcoming enoteca with an original menu of eclectic regional dishes
 (many fine cheeses) is
</p><p>
Cantina della Vetra<br>
via Pio IV 3 (corner of Piazza Vetra)<br>
tel: 02 89403843<br>
<a href="http://www.cantinadellavetra.it/">www.cantinadellavetra.it</a>
</p><p>
It stays open until midnight, does a Sunday brunch, serves draught 
prosecco and a fine selection of wines (the owner is quick to prevent 
you ordering an unsuitable bottle). Best to ring and book, it is often 
crowded, but always friendly.
</p><p>
Finally a fine old-style establishment hidden a block behind FNAC
</p><p>
Ristorante della Collina Pistoiese<br>
via degli Amedei 1<br>
tel: 02 8645 1085
</p><p>
Very fine house white wine, excellent sweet trolley, good old-fashioned service and no music.
</p><p>
<b>Como</b><br>
A run-out concert to the beautifully restored old theatre in Como (see 
photographs elsewhere on this site) ended with a quick after-concert 
snack in the nearby
</p><p>
Albergo Ristorante Sociale<br>
via Maestri Comacini 8<br>
tel: 031 264042
</p><p>
A music-free family establishment 2 minutes from the theatre.
</p><p>
Incidentally, all Italian restaurants are now, by law, non-smoking &#8212; a 
rule which seems to have been accepted without complaint by the 
customers.
</p><p>
Only one establishement broke the rule, and there they operated a 
locked-door policy; the head waiter asked whether we would mind if &#8220;one 
table smoked because they are friends of the chef&#8221;. It transpired that 
ALL tables smoked and the chef also &#8212; but, charmingly, every diner left
 the table and went outside to take mobile phone calls to avoid 
disturbing the atmosphere.
</p><p>
<b>Frankfurt</b><br>
Fewer dining experiences to report from Frankfurt, but in the relatively historical and cosy old part of Bornheim is
</p><p>
&#8220;Zur Sonne&#8221;<br>
Berger Strasse 312<br>
tel: 069 45 9396
</p><p>
which serves tradition snacks with &#8216;apple wine&#8217; (related to cider); the 
most appropriate is a dish of cheese with added chopped onion (the 
addition of onion is described as &#8220;mit Musik&#8221;) served with dark bread. 
Also good beer.</p>
