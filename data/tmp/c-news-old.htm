    <div class="title">Lost and found: Christopher's performances on folk albums from the 60s and 70s</div>

    <div class="leader">
In the process of expanding his online discography,
Christopher was delighted to rediscover several LPs of albums by folk
groups The Young Tradition and Shirley &amp; Dolly Collins, featuring
Christopher himself on the harpsichord.
    </div> <!-- leader -->

    <p>
In a series of unusual but striking collaborations, these young folk
singers joined forces with players from the Early Music Consort on
period instruments, creating what Dolly Collins felt to be the "natural
orchestra" that her arrangements needed. So far we have unearthed copies
 of "Galleries", by The Young Tradition (1968), along with two albums by
 Shirley &amp; Dolly Collins, "Anthems in Eden" (1969) and "Love, Death
and the Lady" (1970).
<p>

Featuring a variety of what were then relatively little-known
instruments including viols, shawm, cornett, sackbut, crumhorns, along
with the harpsichord played by Christopher, these recordings have been
variously referred to as "freak folk" or "folk rock" and represented
something of a departure from Christopher's usual musical style!</p>

<p>
<img src="upload/the-young-tradition-galleries.jpg" alt="the-young-tradition-galleries.jpg" class="imgleft" height="300" width="300"><i>This
 is harsh primordial territory. Murder ballads, tales of wrong-doing and
 punishment meted out by an uncaring society do little to further the
perennial prejudice that all British folk is
'hey-nonny-no-under-the-greenwood' stuff... They're archetypes in which
all of our cultural expressions are rooted and, as such, transcend any
'Olde Englishe' stereotype you care to put on them. This is one album
that'll still be as relevant in a hundred years time. Haunting.</i><br>

 was first performed in 1733 and is widely recognised as one of the
eighteenth century's greatest operas. One of the work's most acclaimed
recordings is that of Christopher Hogwood, with a stellar line-up of
Baroque vocal specialists, including James Bowman in the title role with
 Emma Kirkby and David Thomas. In this recording the orchestral layout
is modelled on contemporary illustrations of opera orchestras, with
first violins and woodwind in front of the second violins and violas,
and with cellos, basses and the two harpsichords placed at the sides.

<p>
 Previously on three CDs, the recording is now reissued as a generous 2CD set.</i>

'James Bowman's portrayal of Orlando is both impassioned and intelligent
[...] Emma Kirkby is perfectly cast in the tragi-comic role of the
shepherdess Dorinda [...] as unfailingly stylish an account as you're
likely to get?' (Gramophone, August 1991)

Two Sonatinas for oboe and piano by Thomas Attwood Walmisley, edited by Christopher for

The
 2nd movement from Sonatina No. 1 in B flat is included on the ABRSM
Grade 7 oboe syllabus, while the complete Sonatina No. 2 is an option

Walmisley's birth (21 January 1814).
<p>
<i>Original music for oboe and piano is relatively rare, especially from
 19th-century England. These two short Sonatinas by Thomas Walmisley, a
composer almost exclusively remembered for his church music, offer an
early Romantic view of classical form and exploit both instruments
ingeniously and with originality.</i>

    <div class="leader">
2014 brings the 300th anniversary of the birth of Carl
 Philip Emmanuel Bach, which falls on 8 March. This year will see a
plethora of musical events across the world to celebrate the life and
works of one of the most prolific and influential composers of the
eighteenth century.
    </div> <!-- leader -->

    <p>
<img src="upload/cpe-bach.jpg" alt="cpe-bach.jpg" class="imgleft" height="237" width="200">
The ongoing edition of <i> C.P.E. Bach: The Complete Works</i>, for
which Christopher chairs the editorial board, is now more than half
complete. In addition to what will be a total of 115 printed volumes,
the edition has also made performance materials available online, along
with constantly updated biographical, musicological and editiorial
information. In this anniversary year, <i> CPEB:CW</i> has
made it easier than ever before for the works of C.P.E. Bach to be performed and appreciated.

 German cities in which C.P.E. Bach lived will, hardly surprisingly, be
marking this occasion with a particularly extensive programme of musical
 events. Berlin, Potsdam and Hamburg, where he lived for much of his
career, are all offering anniversary programmes: the Academy of Ancient
Music and the Kammerorchester C.P.E. Bach will both perform as part of
the concert series at the Konzerthaus Berlin [pictured], while the
Hochschule für Musik und Theater in Hamburg hosts a number of lectures
on C.P.E. Bach's life and works.

The anniversary will also be marked across the world, including the

celebratory exhibitions at Harvard running from 13 January to 5 April.</p>

<i>Few
 composers exemplified the late eighteenth-century Viennese keyboard
style better than Mozart’s contemporary, the Czech composer Leopold
Koželuch. A leading performer and teacher, he was even offered Mozart’s
former post as court organist to the Archbishop of Salzburg. Preferring
instead to preserve his independence he produced, over four decades, a
series of major sonatas for fortepiano and harpsichord worthy to stand
beside those of Haydn, Mozart, Clementi and Dussek, and as a precursor
to those of Beethoven.</i>
<p>
This is the first disc of the complete recording of Koželuch’s 50
keyboard sonatas. The second is due to be released in January 2014, and
the rest at 2-monthly intervals thereafter. The sonatas are performed on
 original and replica instruments from the late eighteenth and early
nineteenth century, several of which come from the performer's own
collection (<a href="http://www.earlykeyboards.co.nz/">The Mobbs Keyboard Collection</a>).
This first disc contains Sonatas 1-4, found in

 had been quick to criticise his first piano trio, Op. 8, the work of a
20-year-old better known as a piano virtuoso. Some 25 years later,
however, upon completion of his second, Op. 87, the by now established
composer could enthuse to his publisher, Simrock: "You have not yet had
such a beautiful trio from me and very likely have not published its
equal in the last ten years!!!"<br>
<p>
This new edition is based on Simrock's first edition, taking into
account differing readings in its score and parts, and draws on evidence
 from Brahms' autograph manuscript; Christopher's introduction details
the composition process and revisions, the first performances and
publications, and their reception. The edition also includes a Critical
Commentary and facsimiles of the autograph score, along with a
reproduction of the remaining fragment of a manuscript cello part
apparently rescued from Brahms' waste-paper basket!</p>

    <b>Arne: <i>Eight Harpsichord Sonatas</i> (1974)</b><br>
    This was Christopher Hogwood&#8217;s first record for <i>L&#8217;Oiseau Lyre</i>,
    and this issue marks its first international CD release. Whereas Arne&#8217;s
    career lay primarily in the theatre (his melodic gifts ensured success
    not only in Italianate opera, but in masque and pantomime as well), an
    appointment in 1754 as composer to the Vauxhall Gardens meant that he
    needed to exercise his talents in keyboard concertos as well as song
    writing. Rarely recorded, the <i>Eight Harpsichord Sonatas</i> (all Arne
    ever composed in this genre) are a delight. The Italianate influence of
    Scarlatti, Zipoli and Alberti is present, but there is also something
    of the <i>galant</i> style of German writers. For this recording, the
    original 1756 edition was used and the recordings were made on Kirckman
    (1766) and Blasser (1744) harpsichords. Christopher Hogwood provides a
    new introductory note to this issue as well as notes on the music and
    the instruments used.

    Weber&#8217;s operas surface reasonably regularly in opera companies&#8217; repertoire around the world, as do his <i>Clarinet Concertos</i> and <i>Clarinet Quintet</i>.
     So it is a joy to welcome to CD for the first time a recording
    specifically selected for reissue by Christopher Hogwood. It was
    recorded with the young Martyn Hill in 1976, and the instrument is an
    original nineteenth-century fortepiano in the Colt Clavier Collection.
    The songs have more than a touch of Schubert about them, but are a
    significant contribution to the Lieder repertoire in their own right.
    The genesis of this project is in itself a story worth telling and

    of the double LP released to accompany the Folio Society&#8217;s publication <i>Music at Court</i> (also written by Christopher Hogwood), the Society commissioned further recordings of music connected with royal courts. The <i>Fitzwilliam Virginal Book</i>, along with <i>Musique pour la Chambre du Roy</i>

    Peerson and Bull, together with anonymous compositions &#8212; the recordings
    were made on different original keyboard instruments: virginal, organ,

    elegant, taking us from the post-Lully era to the final examples of
    great French baroque chamber music, that of Leclair. The collection is
    notable for the pure, unsullied voice of the late Judith Nelson (a

    The leading British conductor and Bach scholar Christopher Hogwood, who
    in 1973 founded the Academy of Ancient Music with its mission to play
    Baroque music on period instruments, tells me that he&#8217;s puzzled by
    students coming his way who, for instance, play minuets every day of
    their lives without knowing how to dance a minuet. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean
    they don&#8217;t play a charming minuet,&#8221; he says, &#8220;but trying to make sense
    of Bach without knowing what was in his world is a compromise. I
    understand that students who practise their instruments for eight hours a
     day are unlikely to want to go to the library to learn about 18th
    century theology. But there&#8217;s no point in playing a choral prelude
    without knowing the chorale. And if you know the chorale you might as
    well know the words that were sung to the chorale; and then you might as
     well know a little bit about 18th century theology, Lutherism and
    Calvinism, and you&#8217;ll be a little closer to what was in Bach&#8217;s world.&#8221;<br>

    Haydn&#8217;s
    first set of Lieder, adapted for the English market by William Shield,
    who was to become his close friend, were an instant commercial success,
    with the most popular of them reissued separately not only in England
    but also in Ireland and America. The present edition reinstates a large
    number of Haydn&#8217;s musical details &#8212; dynamics, articulation, accidentals,
     and even accompanying figures in the keyboard part &#8212; present in his
    German originals but missing from Shield&#8217;s English edition. Generously
    illustrated with facsimiles from the original publications, which were
    notated on two staves, the new edition, the first in 200 years, uses
    three staves to clarify the voice and keyboard parts, and includes an
    Introduction and full Critical Commentary.<br>

    <div class="title">&#8216;John Dowland on the Keyboard&#8217; published in <i>Early Music</i></div>

    <div class="leader">
    The third and final article of Christopher&#8217;s in
    <a href="http://em.oxfordjournals.org/" title="<i>Early Music</i>"><i>Early
    Music</i></a> has just been published (in Volume 41, Issue 2).<p></p>
    </div> <!-- leader -->

    <p>
    As well as being a survey of the numerous examples of John Dowland&#8217;s music arranged for keyboard (a
    selection <a href="http://www.hogwood.org/publications/index.html?page_sub_category_id=2&amp;publication_id=87">
    edited</a> by Christopher in 2005), there is also a transcription of a newly discovered
    arrangement, here published for the first time. See below for the abstract.

    <br clear="all">
    Despite the notable absence of any original &#8216;Dowland keyboard music&#8217;,
    17th-century keyboard players were almost as familiar with the
    composer&#8217;s works as lutenists (who were often one and the same). More
    than 50 English and continental keyboard settings are known to
    survive&#8212;by such respected contemporaries as Bull, Byrd, Farnaby,
    Peerson, Philips, Scheidt and Sweelinck&#8212;but are rarely performed today
    due to mis- givings about the legitimacy of &#8216;arrangements&#8217;. In making
    the case for the reinstatement of these works in the keyboard repertory
    this essay surveys all known manuscript sources (with appendices listing
     modern editions and concordances with the lute originals) and
    illustrates the range of compositional approaches they represent: from
    simple, literal transcriptions to highly virtuosic elaborations, some
    evading and others embracing Dowland&#8217;s striking dissonances. Also
    published here for the first time is a new arrangement by Benjamin Cosyn
     of <i>Lachrymae</i> from a recently discovered manuscript source now part of
    the private collection of William H. and Judith M. Scheide.</p>

    Christopher&#8217;s contribution advocates the use of the &#8216;process&#8217; edition, as opposed to Urtext or <i>Fassung letzer Hand</i>
    editions, as a way of allowing the performer to compare progressive
    versions of a work. This is particularly important in cases such as

    Mendelssohn&#8217;s symphonies where, as Christopher has found in editing
    them, there is sometimes no definitive or truly final version.

     composer V&#225;clav Pichl (1741&#8211;1805) spent much of his working life in
    Vienna, where the Empress Maria Theresa preferred him to Mozart. His
    compositions were performed at Eszterhaza by Haydn, who had a set of
    Pichl&#8217;s &#8220;new quartets&#8221; copied in 1780 (he wrote over 30 quartets in
    all).

    <p>
    Op. 13, the present set of stylish and skilfully contrasted works, were
    dedicated to Dittersdorf, one of his early employers. They exploit all
    four instruments equally (even the viola is allocated elaborate solo
    passages) and offer an attractive alternative to the standard Viennese
    works of this period.

    <div class="title">Weber CD released</div>

    <div class="leader">
    A new CD is now available of piano works by Carl Maria

    with Christopher joining in some four-hand repertoire.

    <br clear="all">
    </p><p>
    The CD features a <a href="http://www.hogwood.org/instruments/index.html?instrument_category_id=5">fortepiano</a> by Joseph Brodmann (Vienna, <i>c</i>1815)
     from Christopher&#8217;s instrument collection, which is associated with
    Weber during his years in Prague as Director of the Estates Theatre
    (1813&#8211;1816), and which was later part of the collection of historic
    instruments belonging to the celebrated Czech singer, Ema Destinnov&#225;
    (Emmy Destinn, 1878&#8211;1930).<br>
    <br>
    Since it cannot be claimed with certainty that any extant piano work was
     conceived at this Brodmann piano, the programme for this, the
    instrument&#8217;s debut recording, is drawn from amongst the works Weber had
    already completed prior to his arrival in Prague, works which were part
    of the experience that informed his selection of the instruments he kept
     there and which he may have played at these instruments for his own
    recreation.<br>
    <br>
    The programme includes Weber&#8217;s Piano Sonata No. 1 in C major Op. 24 and <i>Variations on an
    Original Theme</i> Op. 2, as well as Six Pieces for Piano Duet Op. 10 with Christopher joining
    Duncan at the fortepiano.
