    <div class="title"><i>Geminiani Opera Omnia</i> debuts at Frankfurt</div>
    <div class="date">March 24, 2010</div>
    <div class="leader">
The inaugural volume of <a href="http://www.francescogeminiani.com/"><i>Geminiani Opera Omnia</i></a>, 
a series directed by Christopher, will be unveiled today at <a href="http://musik.messefrankfurt.com/frankfurt/en/besucher/willkommen.html">Musikmesse Frankfurt</a>, 
internationally the main event of the music trade calendar, by its publisher, <a href="http://www.utorpheus.com/">Ut Orpheus Edizioni</a>.
 The volume, also edited by Christopher, comprises both cello and violin
 versions of Geminiani's Opus 5 sonatas, which, criticised upon their 
publication in 1746 for being too demanding and fantastical, have 
ironically attracted subsequent interest for the same reasons to the 
extent that they are now perhaps his most greatly esteemed works.

<b>Francesco Geminiani Opera Omnia</b> is an editorial and publishing 
project that presents all the works of Geminiani (1687-1762) &#8212; 
instrumental, vocal and didactic &#8212; in full critical editions, to 
celebrate the 250th anniversary of the composer's death in 2012.

Although Geminiani was held to be the equal of 
Corelli in his own day &#8212; and indeed thought by some to be superior to 
his contemporary Handel in instrumental composition &#8212; his considerable 
output has only been available in piecemeal fashion, much of it never 
reissued since his lifetime except in facsimile. Largely inaccessible to
 the modern performer, the enormous originality he showed both in 
writing and re-writing his own music, and that of Corelli, his teacher, 
has been concealed. <i>Francesco Geminiani Opera Omnia</i> is the first 
uniform and accurate scholarly edition of all versions of his music and 
writings in a form that allows pertinent comparison and re-evaluation.

</p><p>
Opus 5 is one such collection that benefits from the co-publication of 
its various incarnations, in this case as cello sonatas and violin 
sonatas. Without the evidence of the title page stating clearly that the
 latter were "transposed for the violin with such changes as are 
appropriate and necessary for that instrument" it would be natural to 
assume that the violin versions were Geminiani's original, and the cello
 versions a transcription; in fact, the six sonatas of Opus 5 are 
Geminiani's only solo works for cello. Four of the cello sonatas are 
transposed in their violin version, but not by the obvious expedient of 
simply raising the tonality by a fifth. All the sonatas, including the 
two that remain in their original keys, are substantially recomposed and
 a comparison of any pair of equivalent sonatas illustrates Geminiani&#8217;s 
acute sense of the distinctive character of each instrument.

<p>Setting the precedent for the series, the volume &#8212; <i>Geminiani Opera Omnia</i>
 Volume 5 &#8212; includes a full critical commentary and facsimiles, together
 with an introduction. An Appendix explains how Geminiani sought 
protection of his works in a society where international copyright did 
not exist and where publishing piracy was rife; Geminiani was the first 
composer to initiate legal proceedings to protect his works and by the 
time Opus 5 was published he was the most legally-protexted composer of 
the century. Printing privileges are shown in their original English, 
French and Dutch, just as in future volumes didactic treatises issued in
 English will be accompanied by any Italian, French and German 
translations of the period.

</p><p>
Next in the series to be published will be Volume 8, which 
presents Geminiani's 6 Concertos after Corelli Opp. 1 &amp; 3, the 3 
Select Concertos and the 2 Unison Concertos. Musikmesse Frankfurt runs 
March 24-27, 2010.</p>
