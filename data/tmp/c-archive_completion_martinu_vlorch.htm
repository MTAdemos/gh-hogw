 2008 saw the release of the forth and final volume of Martin&#367;&#8217;s 
Complete Music for violin and orchestra. The recording (Hyperion 67674) 
with Bohuslav Matou&#353;ek and the Czech Philharmonic features Martin&#367;&#8217;s 
first and second violin concertos and has been warmly received by both 
critics and listeners alike. 
</p><p>
&#8220;It is good to find an English conductor, Christopher Hogwood, 
championing these attractive works with a Czech orchestra. While No 1 is
 vaguely Stravinskyan, No 2 is broader and more poetic with a 
particularly seductive slow movement. Bohuslav Matou&#353;ek is a persuasive 
advocate of both works. No 1 was recorded in 2001 and has been issued on
 another label.&#8221; <br>
(Michael Kennedy, The Telegraph, 14th September 2008, 4*)</p>

<p>
"Christopher Hogwood is a surprisingly idiomatic interpreter of 
Martin&#367;&#8217;s oeuvre...Combine a remarkably good conductor with a superb 
orchestra with a deep understanding of the works of one of their native 
sons, and the recipe is an undoubtedly good one." <br>

MARTINU&#8217;S Concerto No 1 for violin and orchestra H 226 (recte H 228/233,
 originally H 232 bis) has a very complicated story. In the early 1930s 
Bohuslav Martinu was already well established in Paris, where he had 
arrived from Prague in 1923. He became a highly respected composer with 
performances of his operas, ballets, orchestral works and chamber music 
in several European cities as well as in the USA. His music earned 
awards and he was commissioned to write new works by both musicians and 
music institutions. Since it was well known that he originally played 
the violin (for some years, indeed, as a member of the Czech 
Philharmonic), it was only a matter of time before he received a 
commission for a violin concerto.</p>

<p>
The commission came from the celebrated Polish-born American violinist 
Samuel Dushkin, the man who in the summer of 1931 inspired Igor 
Stravinsky to compose a violin concerto, and was supported by the 
publisher Willy Strecker, the owner of the Schott publishing house. This
 was at the time when Schott negotiated an exclusive contract with 
Martinu, which would have placed the composer among an elite group of 
composers with such a comprehensive publishing deal, alongside the likes
 of Paul Hindemith. (This explains the large correspondence between 
Martinu and Strecker, which helps us to trace the creation of his violin
 concerto virtually step by step.) Only the rise of the nationalist 
socialist politics in Germany with their aversion against the so-called 
&#8216;degenerated music&#8217; prevented Schott from fulfilling this contract.</p>

<p>
Martinu knew Dushkin from Paris, where they both lived in the early 
1930s. He was present at Dushkin&#8217;s performance of Stravinsky&#8217;s violin 
concerto with the composer conducting. However, it seems that Martinu&#8217;s 
desire to write a concerto came independently, since on 22 May 1931, 
before Stravinsky started to work with Dushkin, he had already mentioned
 in a letter to Willy Strecker that he planned &#8216;to work with Mr Dushkin 
on a violin concerto&#8217;. Four months later, on 24 September 1931, Martinu 
confirmed to Strecker that he had spoken to Dushkin and was &#8216;ready to 
start composing the violin concerto&#8217;. On 9 December 1931, the day after 
his forty-first birthday, Martinu reported to Strecker that the concerto
 was ready and that he was &#8216;going to look over it with Mr Dushkin&#8217;.</p>

<p>
From this remark it is obvious that Martinu did not yet appreciate 
Dushkin&#8217;s idea of cooperation on a new musical work. Dushkin was famous 
for taking an active role in influencing the composers he worked with. 
While for Stravinsky, a pianist, this was very welcome&#8212;he had noted in 
his autobiography that Dushkin&#8217;s availability for advice was a factor in
 his undertaking the violin concerto&#8212;for the violinist Martinu this was a
 new experience and caused a lot of difficulties.</p>

<p>
However, on 27 October Martinu was still quite hopeful. He wrote to 
Strecker that &#8216;the work on the concerto continues very well, Mr Dushkin 
is very contended&#8217;. For a composer who was used to writing quickly&#8212;in 
1931 he finished twelve compositions and worked on the ballet 
Spalicek&#8212;it must have been a nightmare to return again and again to a 
piece he regarded as being completed. More than fifteen months later, on
 8 February 1833, Martinu wrote to his relatives in Policka that he had 
done &#8216;a lot of work on the concerto for Dushkin&#8217;. Eight days later he 
reported that he had finished the work, and that Dushkin was &#8216;very 
happy&#8217; with it.</p>

<p>
Dushkin took the new concerto to the USA, where he sought opportunities 
to perform it&#8212;&#8216;very soon, probably in Philadelphia&#8217;, according to 
Martinu (in a letter to his mother on 9 June 1933). However, this proved
 overly optimistic, as we can see from the composer&#8217;s letter to his 
family in Policka of 27 June, where he says that &#8216;Dushkin will return 
from the US in August and would like to do a final revision of the 
concerto&#8217;. At this time Martinu&#8217;s close friend Stanislav Novak, the 
leader of the Czech Philharmonic under Talich, revealed his interest in 
performing the concerto in Prague, but Dushkin refused to give 
permission as he wanted to do this himself. In September Martinu 
reported that Dushkin had returned to Paris and that they were to 
undertake &#8216;the definitive editing of the concert&#8217;. A few days later it 
looks as if Novak&#8217;s interest in performing the work stimulated Dushkin, 
and Martinu reported to his mother that &#8216;Dushkin is going to perform the
 violin concerto in Prague, probably in January&#8217;. Schott were advised to
 send the fee for the concerto to Paris, which indicates that everything
 was at last reaching a conclusion. But again nothing happened, probably
 because of the political upheaval in Germany in 1933 and 1934.</p>

<p>
Other proposed premieres of the concerto with Dushkin, including a 
performance at the New German Theatre in Prague in the autumn of 1934, 
were not realized. Four years later Dushkin prevented Louis Krasner from
 performing the work in the United States (according to a letter from 
Martinu to Strecker on 4 March 1938). Probably during World War II, when
 Martinu was forced to hide his autographs in Europe and flee to the 
USA, the score of the concerto was lost. It was discovered by Harry 
Halbreich in 1968 in the Moldenhauer Archives at the Northwestern 
University of Spokane (Washington). It was not until 25 October 1973 
that the concerto received its premiere, in Chicago, with Josef Suk as 
the soloist and Georg Solti conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.</p>


<p>
The first movement, Allegro moderato, reveals the influence of Dushkin&#8217;s
 violin playing, especially his liking for technical display. The short 
orchestral opening, centred on E, introduces the short syncopated 
motivic &#8216;cell&#8217; (as the composer described it), which comprises six 
notes, five of them being E in different registers (with a short D being
 the other note). The solo violin takes up the main cell in a bravura 
passage full of double, triple and quadruple stops, harmonics and other 
virtuoso techniques. In the course of the movement the most significant 
elements are long passages written out in full triple stops and bright 
arpeggios. Martinu reveals his intimate understanding of the violin and 
his knowledge of the virtuoso violin literature he learned to play as a 
young boy in Policka. It is difficult to separate out his own background
 expertise and any special wishes of Dushkin, although it seems likely 
that the passages where the violin almost imitates a guitar demonstrate 
more of Dushkin&#8217;s ideas than do the lyrical and melodic passages, which 
are typical of Martinu&#8217;s output. Quite unusual for Martinu is the vast 
space he gives to the variations of the opening cell. It is not until 
the middle of the movement that he introduces a contrasting motif, in a 
mild E minor, where the violin sings in one long phrase a melody of 
outstanding beauty and simplicity, in the style of a Moravian folk song.
 To underline the change of mood, the accompaniment changes from a full 
orchestral staccato to tremolos in the strings. At the end of this 
extremely short (just 22 bars) but important section the melody of the 
solo violin is joined by a solo cello. The following reprise returns 
almost literally to the material of the opening section, first in A 
minor before finishing in the home key of E minor.</p>

<p>
The second movement, Andante, is built on a broad cantilena, 
stylistically very close to the contemporaneous folk-ballet Spalicek H 
214. Its pendulum-like melodic line is based on the alternation of a 
central tone with upper and lower notes, mostly at the interval of a 
fourth. 
</p><p>
The closing movement is an Allegretto (although this designation does 
not appear in the original manuscript and was assigned by the concerto&#8217;s
 editors, the violinist Josef Suk, the conductor Zdenek Kosler and the 
Dvorak scholar Jarmil Burghauser). It starts attacca with a short main 
thematic cell. As in the first movement this is very short, here 
consisting of just five notes, with four of them being A (the other note
 is a B flat), but this time not distributed in different octaves. 
Melodically, the opening orchestral section continues the Spalicek-like 
character of the second movement. The entrance of the solo violin, 
however, with its richly ornamented writing, again bears Dushkin&#8217;s 
stamp. Its simple melodic line is decorated with several appoggiaturas. 
This is interrupted surprisingly quickly by a series of short solo 
cadenzas for the violin, and in one of these Martinu combines the solo 
violin in a highly original way with the snare drum&#8212;he returned to this 
distinctive timbre years later in the last movement of the Suite 
concertante H 276 (also commissioned by Dushkin, see volume 3) as well 
as in his Phantaisies symphoniques (Symphony No 6) H 343.</p>

<p>
The Violin Concerto No 2 H 293 is different in every respect from its 
predecessor, stylistically and it terms of its fate. It was commissioned
 by Mischa Elman (1891&#8211;1967), a famous American violinist of Ukrainian 
origin, a former child prodigy and student of Brodsky in Odessa and 
Leopold Auer in St Petersburg. Although born just two months later than 
Martinu, Elman gave his Berlin and London debuts before the composer 
even entered the Conservatory in Prague. 
</p><p>
Milos Safranek, a friend and fiery supporter of Martinu, reports in his 
biography from 1944 that Elman attended a concert of the Boston Symphony
 in Carnegie Hall in early January 1943 hoping to hear Shostakovich&#8217;s 
seventh symphony, but walked instead into the New York premiere of 
Martinu&#8217;s Symphony No 1. After the overwhelming success of this 
symphony, which made Martinu famous in the USA almost overnight, Elman 
visited the composer and asked him to write a violin concerto for him. 
This must have been an interesting meeting, since it is difficult to 
imagine a bigger contrast between the activities of the soloist, focused
 mainly on repertoire of the eighteenth (Vivaldi, Bach) and especially 
the nineteenth centuries (Beethoven, Schubert, Wieniawski, Tchaikovsky, 
Dvorak), and the composer, who had been based in Paris, one of the most 
important centres of contemporary music. It is not surprising that the 
paths of Martinu and Elman had not previously crossed.</p>

<p>
In the programme of the premiere of the Violin Concerto No 2 Safranek 
recalls the circumstances of their first encounter: &#8216;Martinu&#8217;s 
monosyllabic manner was puzzling to Elman, who tried to break the ice by
 inquiring if he had heard any of the living world-famous violinists. 
&#8220;No&#8221;, was the reply. &#8220;Are you by any chance familiar with my playing?&#8221; 
ventured Elman. &#8220;No&#8221;, said Martinu flatly. There was a prolonged 
silence. Finally Elman tried to resolve the situation by taking Martinu 
to his studio and playing to him for half an hour or so. The composer 
listened very attentively, though with complete impassivity. After the 
last note Elman, very naturally, stood and waited for his reaction. But 
Martinu continued to sit in sphinx-like silence, which remained unbroken
 until he got up to leave and the two musicians bade each other an 
awkward goodbye. The violinist was completely baffled, and feared his 
scheme must result in failure. Before long, however, Martinu duly 
appeared with the finished score of a new violin concerto.&#8217; This 
anecdote is supported by several other artists&#8212;Louis Moyse among 
them&#8212;who reported similar experiences in their dealings with Martinu.</p>

<p>
Martinu composed the concerto in just two months, from 23 February to 26
 April 1943, in his home in New York City. The work&#8217;s main 
characteristics recall the qualities of Elman&#8217;s playing, notably his 
unique sound, his preference for noble and elegant melodies, his 
exceptional feeling for the sonority of his instrument, his love of slow
 tempos, and his rich use of rubato and portamento. 
</p><p>
In the programme of the premiere, Martinu described the concerto in some
 detail: &#8216;The idea for this concerto presented itself to me with the 
following order&#8212;Andante, a broad lyric song of great intensity which 
leads to a Poco allegro, exploiting the technique and the virtuosity of 
the instrument, and has the aspect of a single-movement composition. The
 definitive form complies with concerto structure. I have preserved its 
grave character, lyric in the first part, and even in the middle 
Allegro, the Andante theme returns to close the movement. The second 
part [Andante moderato] is a sort of point of rest, a bridge progressing
 towards the final Poco allegro. It is an intermezzo moderato, almost 
bucolic, accompanied by only a part of the orchestra and progressing 
attacca into the finale, which is Poco allegro. This movement favours 
the technique of the violin, which is interrupted by broad and massive 
tutti passages. The concerto ends with a sort of stretto, Allegro 
(vivo).&#8217; In his general thoughts on violin concertos of the past that 
follows, Martinu distinguishes several types of use of the solo violin 
and clearly prefers those which emphasize &#8216;inherent beauty of tone&#8217;.</p>

<p>
According to Martinu&#8217;s programme notes for the premiere, the cadenza at 
the end of the first part was added subsequently at Elman&#8217;s suggestion. 
From Martinu&#8217;s letters to the Czech publisher Karel Sebanek it is 
obvious that he made some corrections to the score, probably in two 
stages. On 10 October 1947 he wrote: &#8216;I would like to make some changes 
in the cadenzas but I do not know where and whether to do so at all.&#8217; 
More than a month later, on 18 November 1947, Martinu admitted to 
Sebanek that he had already &#8216;made some changes in the score after the 
premiere of the concerto&#8217;, and was not sure if the publisher had the 
corrected copy or not. The original manuscripts of the concerto (at 
least three are reported in the composer&#8217;s correspondence) and the 
handwritten piano reduction remain missing, so we cannot be certain 
whether final revisions are included in the published version. The fact 
that Martinu later greeted the receipt of five printed scores sent to 
him on 3 December 1949, describing them as &#8216;splendid&#8217;, missing only the 
dedication to Mischa Elman, is offset by his well-known, rather cursory 
approach to proofreading.</p>

<p>
The premiere of the concerto took place in Boston on 31 December 1943, 
with the Boston Symphony conducted by Sergey Koussevitzky. Happily it 
was broadcast and much later released on CD&#8212;a priceless document that 
highlights the personal character of this concerto and how it was 
tailored to Mischa Elman. Elman retained exclusivity with this concerto 
for three years after its premiere, and performed it often. After his 
exclusivity expired in 1946 the concerto was taken up by several 
violinist; in a letter to Sebanek from 7 January 1947 Martinu mentions 
&#8216;a big interest in the concerto&#8217;, citing &#8216;the brilliant young violinist 
Isaac Stern&#8217; as one of the musicians investigating the work. Other 
violinists who performed the concerto include Louis Kaufman, Bruno 
Belcik and especially Josef Suk, who performed this concerto many times 
and in 1978 received the Grand Prix du Disque de l&#8217;Acad&#233;mie Charles Cros
 for his recording with Vaclav Neumann and the Czech Philharmonic.

 inquiring if he had heard any of the living world-famous violinists. 
&#8220;No&#8221;, was the reply. &#8220;Are you by any chance familiar with my playing?&#8221; 
ventured Elman. &#8220;No&#8221;, said Martin&#367; flatly. There was a prolonged 
silence. Finally Elman tried to resolve the situation by taking Martin&#367; 
to his studio and playing to him for half an hour or so. The composer 
listened very attentively, though with complete impassivity. After the 
last note Elman, very naturally, stood and waited for his reaction. But 
Martin&#367; continued to sit in sphinx-like silence, which remained unbroken
 until he got up to leave and the two musicians bade each other an 
awkward goodbye. The violinist was completely baffled, and feared his 
scheme must result in failure. Before long, however, Martin&#367; duly 
appeared with the finished score of a new violin concerto.&#8217; This 
anecdote is supported by several other artists&#8212;Louis Moyse among 
them&#8212;who reported similar experiences in their dealings with Martin&#367;.</p>

<p>
Martin&#367; composed the concerto in just two months, from 23 February to 26
 April 1943, in his home in New York City. The work&#8217;s main 
characteristics recall the qualities of Elman&#8217;s playing, notably his 
unique sound, his preference for noble and elegant melodies, his 
exceptional feeling for the sonority of his instrument, his love of slow
 tempos, and his rich use of rubato and portamento.

In the programme of the premiere, Martin&#367; described the concerto in some
 detail: &#8216;The idea for this concerto presented itself to me with the 
following order&#8212;Andante, a broad lyric song of great intensity which 
leads to a Poco allegro, exploiting the technique and the virtuosity of 
the instrument, and has the aspect of a single-movement composition. The
 definitive form complies with concerto structure. I have preserved its 
grave character, lyric in the first part, and even in the middle 
Allegro, the Andante theme returns to close the movement. The second 
part [Andante moderato] is a sort of point of rest, a bridge progressing
 towards the final Poco allegro. It is an intermezzo moderato, almost 
bucolic, accompanied by only a part of the orchestra and progressing 
attacca into the finale, which is Poco allegro. This movement favours 
the technique of the violin, which is interrupted by broad and massive 
tutti passages. The concerto ends with a sort of stretto, Allegro 
(vivo).&#8217; In his general thoughts on violin concertos of the past that 
follows, Martin&#367; distinguishes several types of use of the solo violin 
and clearly prefers those which emphasize &#8216;inherent beauty of tone&#8217;.</p>

<p>
According to Martin&#367;&#8217;s programme notes for the premiere, the cadenza at 
the end of the first part was added subsequently at Elman&#8217;s suggestion. 
From Martin&#367;&#8217;s letters to the Czech publisher Karel Sebanek it is 
obvious that he made some corrections to the score, probably in two 
stages. On 10 October 1947 he wrote: &#8216;I would like to make some changes 
in the cadenzas but I do not know where and whether to do so at all.&#8217; 
More than a month later, on 18 November 1947, Martin&#367; admitted to 
Sebanek that he had already &#8216;made some changes in the score after the 
premiere of the concerto&#8217;, and was not sure if the publisher had the 
corrected copy or not. The original manuscripts of the concerto (at 
least three are reported in the composer&#8217;s correspondence) and the 
handwritten piano reduction remain missing, so we cannot be certain 
whether final revisions are included in the published version. The fact 
that Martin&#367; later greeted the receipt of five printed scores sent to 
him on 3 December 1949, describing them as &#8216;splendid&#8217;, missing only the 
dedication to Mischa Elman, is offset by his well-known, rather cursory 
approach to proofreading.</p>

<p>
The premiere of the concerto took place in Boston on 31 December 1943, 
with the Boston Symphony conducted by Sergey Koussevitzky. Happily it 
was broadcast and much later released on CD&#8212;a priceless document that 
highlights the personal character of this concerto and how it was 
tailored to Mischa Elman. Elman retained exclusivity with this concerto 
for three years after its premiere, and performed it often. After his 
exclusivity expired in 1946 the concerto was taken up by several 
violinist; in a letter to Sebanek from 7 January 1947 Martin&#367; mentions 
&#8216;a big interest in the concerto&#8217;, citing &#8216;the brilliant young violinist 
Isaac Stern&#8217; as one of the musicians investigating the work. Other 
violinists who performed the concerto include Louis Kaufman, Bruno 
Belcik and especially Josef Suk, who performed this concerto many times 
and in 1978 received the Grand Prix du Disque de l&#8217;Acad&#233;mie Charles Cros
 for his recording with Vaclav Neumann and the Czech Philharmonic.
