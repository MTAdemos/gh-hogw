With the opening of the Handel House Museum in November 2001, and the 
current Discovering Handel festival at the South Bank, it seems that 
Handel is hip again. Last month, journalist Charlotte Higgins asked 
various musicians, directors and writers why they love Handel. 
Christopher said

</p><p style="padding-left:24px; padding-right:24px;">
<i>It interests me that Handel was never a paid employee. Even when he 
lived in the homes of noble patrons he was treated as an aristocratic 
guest; he was always on the right side of the baize door. He always 
worked on his own terms, and this Churchillian strength of character 
comes across in his music. He was fearless. He could tell the whole 
story of Christianity in a single oratorio; he could depict in music &#8212; 
using just a single line of strings &#8212; the sun standing still. And yet 
his music never has a &#8216;look at me&#8217; quality. There was never any sense of
 the ivory tower with Handel. They say he could swear in nine languages.</i><br>
