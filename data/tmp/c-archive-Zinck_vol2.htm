When
 Zinck's sonatas first appeared in print in 1783, the publication was 
greeted as exceptional by the best European critics: "Their interesting 
melodic style, highly developed turns of phrase, great diversity of 
musical ideas unified into one great sonata style far removed from the 
routine, and finally, very descriptive tone-painting, elevate them and 
make them worthy of the approval of connoisseurs".
</p><p>
Zinck had studied with C. P. E. Bach in Hamburg, and the influence of <i>Empfindsamkeit</i>
 is very apparent in his works. But there are later and interesting 
changes as he evolved a more Italianate keyboard manner, and also 
incorporated elements of the folk and popular music encountered during 
his residence in Denmark. 
</p><p>
The Complete Keyboard Works also contain a number of didactic studies 
(several with full fingering) and simple sets of variations for teaching
 purposes, many of them never before published.
</p><p>
The composer followed C. P. E. Bach in promoting the use of the 
clavichord, but his music is equally successful on the fortepiano, and 
would provide a welcome novelty today both for recital programming and 
in teaching.
</p><p>
The second instalment of the three-volume collection of Zinck&#8217;s complete
 keyboard music contains the printed sonatas which followed his 
enormously successful 1783 set together with the first appearance in 
print of two sonatas from a manuscript source in the Royal Library, 
Copenhagen. The published sonatas show Zinck&#8217;s mastery of the styles of 
both C.P.E. Bach (his teacher) and Haydn, while the manuscript works are
 simpler in their technical demands, but include original fingering from
 the composer. All the sonatas in this volume would be effective on 
either clavichord or fortepiano.</p>
