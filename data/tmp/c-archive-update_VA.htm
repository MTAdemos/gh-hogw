<img src="upload/VAimages.jpg" alt="images.jpg" class="imgleft" height="80" width="124">Following
 the meeting of 4 February, where the public had the opportunity to put 
forward their opinion on the move of the musical instruments, the 
V&amp;A has issued a <a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/furniture/furniture_features/musical_instruments/index.html">press release</a>
 with information about what will be happening to the instruments from 
the gallery that was closed to the public 22 February 2010.

</p><p>
The museum intends to loan the instruments to various British 
institutions, although it does not specify which, and in the mean time 
they are being kept locked away, available to view by appointment only. 
Hopefully this appointments book will be kept full for as long as they 
are in storage.

</p><p>
They have, however, confirmed that a large number of the instruments will be lent to the <a href="http://www.horniman.ac.uk/">Horniman Museum</a> for public viewing. <a href="http://www.horniman.ac.uk/pdf/Press_Statement_Musical_Instruments.pdf">Click Here</a> to view the official press release from the Horniman Museum.</p>
