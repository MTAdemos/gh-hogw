<p>Despite gloomy news elsewhere, the 
<a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/a5af1a38-77e2-11de-9713-00144feabdc0.html"><i>Financial Times</i></a> 
recently turned its attention to the literary response to the 200th anniversary of Haydn's death and was pleased to find

</p><p>
'The
 enthusiasm for and knowledge of the music that the English 
conductor-harpsichordist Christopher Hogwood communicates in the concert
 hall are reflected in <i>Haydn's Visits to England</i>, a brisk and 
breezy roundup of contemporary source material for the composer's two 
action-packed London residencies in the early 1790s. This was the period
 that sealed Haydn's international celebrity: he was lionised by English
 high society in a way that makes his long service at the Esterh&#225;zy 
court seem prosaic and his condescending recognition by the imperial 
family in Vienna quite scandalous. England gave his music an urbanity 
and daring it had hitherto lacked. Without those "London" symphonies and
 the late, quasi-orchestral string quartets, not to mention the two 
great pantheistic oratorios on English texts, Haydn&#8217;s reputation would 
be that of a minor composer.

</p><p>
'Hogwood's is the only volume to 
quote extensively from the notebooks Haydn made during his visits to 
Britain, and they are more than worth the read, for they speak to us, 
unadulterated, of his meticulousness, his industriousness, his innate 
curiosity, his flawless propriety, his fundamental modesty and his 
dutifulness &#8211; the quality that impelled him, exhausted by London's 
non-stop demands and charms, to return to a quieter life at home.'
