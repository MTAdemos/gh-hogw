    <p>
Mendelssohn&#8217;s Symphony no. 5 (the so-called "Reformation Symphony") was 
actually the second symphony that the composer wrote; completed in 1830,
 it had to wait until 1832 for its first performance. It received only 
one other performance during Mendelssohn&#8217;s lifetime which was conducted 
by Julius Reitz in 1837.
</p><p>
In this new edition Christopher draws on all known sources, making 
compelling arguments for the inclusion of some of the cuts made after 
the first performance, including an entire movement which has never 
before been published. 
</p><p>
This new edition is complemented by facsimiles and a Critical Commentary.
