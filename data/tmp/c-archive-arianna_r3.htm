"It was the direction of Christopher Hogwood that will be the lasting memory", wrote Andrew Benson-Wilson 
in <a href="http://www.kings-music.co.uk/emr.htm"><i>Early Music Review</i></a>
 of the performance of May 17. "Unusually for my concert reviews, 
readers will be able to decide if I am talking nonsense as this concert 
will be broadcast as part of the BBC Radio 3 Handel opera series on 24 
September at 2pm. I hope you find it as enthralling as I did."

On account of its length, the opera will be broadcast over two days, 
concluding with Act III on Friday 25 September at 2pm. The broadcasts 
will subsequently be available for a week on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/radio/bbc_radio_three">BBC iPlayer</a>.
