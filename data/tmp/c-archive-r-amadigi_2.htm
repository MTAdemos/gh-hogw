In its latest edition (Number 120 &#8211; August 2007), <i>Early Music Review</i> has published a review of the Barbican performance of <i>Amadigi</i>, conducted by Christopher. Here is a snippet from the review
by Andrew Benson-Wilson:

</p><p>
'...The first star was Christopher Hogwood, one of the most technically 
correct conductors around. He has a very clear beat, no awkward 
mannerisms, graceful and flowing movements that help to make him an 
attractive conductor to watch, and an overall feeling that he is serving
 the music, rather than attempting to get the music to serve him. What 
joy!...'</p>
