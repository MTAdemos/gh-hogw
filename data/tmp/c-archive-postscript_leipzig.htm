Christopher writes from Dubrovnik about the tote 
distributed to each jury member in Leipzig last month: "As I suspected, 
the much despised green satchel proved absolutely wonderful as a beach 
bag in Croatia. Not only has such a colour never been seen before on the
 Dalmatian coast, but the German text appeared to add territorial 
strength, and our beach-towels were never once disturbed."
