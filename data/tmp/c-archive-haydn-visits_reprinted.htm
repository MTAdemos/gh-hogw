&#8216;Haydn&#8217;s life story, he himself insisted, could interest nobody. For his own epitaph he suggested simply <i>Vixi, scripsi, dixi</i>: I lived, I wrote,
I spoke.&#8217;

So begins Christopher&#8217;s Prelude to his 1980 book on <i>Haydn&#8217;s Visits to England</i>.
 Evidently, though, Haydn was wrong &#8212; certainly he was by all accounts 
extremely modest &#8212; for in this anniversary year it is not just his music
 that is receiving inevitably increased attention: Christopher&#8217;s classic
 text has just been reprinted by

 a fascinating glimpse into late 18th-century life, politics and 
music-making; beautifully designed; absorbing and full of wry anecdotes;
 this book will appeal to music lovers and historians alike.

In September 1790, following the death of his princely employer, Joseph 
Haydn and his entire orchestra were sacked. However, Haydn received an 
unexpected visit from Johann Peter Salomon, a German impresario based in
 London, who made him a tempting offer: an opera, six symphonies and 
twenty other pieces to be written for the city, and a guaranteed income 
from a new concert series.
</p><p>
So, on 2 January 1791, Haydn arrived in England for the first of two 
visits that would leave an indelible mark both on the musical life of 
his host country and on the composer himself.
</p><p>
Using Haydn&#8217;s original letters and notebooks, and accounts by 
contemporaries, Christopher Hogwood brings a fascinating period vividly 
to life, as Haydn is taken up by London society, travels into the 
country, plays for the royal family and writes some of his most famous 
music. Haydn&#8217;s jottings reveal an insatiable curiosity (and occasional 
astonishment) at English manners, morals and customs, but it is the 
gentle humour and generosity of this highly original composer that makes
 the greatest impression.</p>
