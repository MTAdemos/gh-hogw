Since I was rather pointedly asked by a Spanish journalist how it was 
that, despite having a food column, I had never yet mentioned a single 
restaurant in Granada, it seems polite to revive the Food Counter this 
month [February 2007] to mention good eating around the Alhambra (where 
the concert hall of the Granada Orchestra is also situated).

So I can pass on recommendations for three eating places all within very
 easy walking distance of the Alhambra itself — one actually inside it. 
This is the restaurant of the Parador, the hotel within the walled 
Moorish palace, which is open to all (no need to buy the ticket which 
entitles you to see round the historical site) and serves a wide range 
of good, and sometimes very local, food. Much recommended is the almond 
and garlic soup (if everyone agrees) known as Ajo blanco, which comes 
with ‘croutons’ of apple; there are also several local solutions of how 
to cook goat, and many fish dishes. There can also, if you ask, be no 
muzak.

<p>
Inside the alternative establishment, the grandiose Alhambra Palace 
Hotel, is also another fine traditional style restaurant for lunches and
 dinners (both starting and ending late) with a terrace overlooking the 
modern town and with a view of the snow-topped Sierra Nevada (but, alas,
 also of the cloud of smog sometimes blanketing the city). Good wine 
list, including several actually from Granada itself. The décor of the 
hotel is all copied from the historical palace (apparently so that tour 
guides could demonstrate details to the 19th-century travellers without 
leaving the comfort of the hotel).
<p>
<img class="imgleft" src="upload/carmensanmiguel-sm.jpg">Specially
 recommended, and only a stone throw’s walk from the Alhambra Palace 
(and again just outside the walls of the castle) is the Restaurante 
Carmen de San Miguel (Plaza Torres Bermejas 3, Alhambra, tel. 958 226 
723, <a href="http://www.carmensanmiguel.com/">www.carmensanmiguel.com</a>).
 Claiming with some justification (the locals assure me) to offer the 
best cooking of Andalusia, it takes a slightly more nouvelle approach to
 traditional dishes, and makes some refreshing variants on 
over-exhibited Spanish staples like gazpacho, imaginative combinations 
of sea-food with fruits (fresh and preserved) and some impressive cod 
cooked in a complete casing of salt, which is tapped to crack it at the 
table and the fish extracted (not tasting over-salted at all). Again, 
the music can be made to disappear on request.
<p>
If it sounds as though I hardly had to leave the Alhambra hill during my concert week in Granada, that is about correct.</p>
