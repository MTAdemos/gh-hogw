<h3>CD SLEEVE NOTES</h3>

<p>
ON 29 JANUARY 1941 the Swiss conductor Paul Sacher wrote to Bohuslav 
Martinu in Lisbon: &#8216;I am preparing the general programme for the 1941&#8211;2 
season. I need a modern piece for violin and orchestra and would like to
 ask you if you would be willing to write a concerto of this kind. I am 
looking for a composition of some fifteen to twenty minutes that would 
be suitable for my leader Madame Gertrud Fl&#252;gel. She is a violinist of 
tremendous technique, a very musical artist, who specializes in vigorous
 movements bursting with strength and momentum rather than in the 
elegant and witty genre. Nevertheless, her soft playing has an intimate 
charm. I don&#8217;t know if you remember her? The accompanying orchestra 
should be limited to just strings with a percussion and piano according 
to your choice.&#8217;
</p><p>
The commission for the Concerto da camera H285 for violin, piano, 
timpani, percussion and string orchestra arrived at a turning point in 
Martinu&#8217;s life. Since July 1940 he had been engaged in a highly dramatic
 escape from France, where he had lived for seventeen years and achieved
 a remarkable reputation, but which was now occupied by the German army.
 His emigration to the USA marked a radical change in Martinu&#8217;s 
lifestyle. On 6 April 1941, he referred to this in his letter to Sacher:
 &#8216;I arrived here [in New York] in a lamentable condition, [&#8230;] but I have
 to work a lot since I don&#8217;t have enough of my music with me, and 
everybody asks me for scores which unfortunately remain in Europe, so I 
have to compose new pieces.&#8217; But it proved to be more difficult than the
 composer expected. In his next letter to Paul Sacher (14 June 1941) he 
admits that even if he had &#8216;the firm intention to write the [proposed] 
concerto for violin&#8217; he had not &#8216;taken into account the great change nor
 the reaction to all those recent events. I started to work but the 
result is not at all good; I have to admit that the new life here 
absorbs me too much, giving me no time to look after myself, and I am 
banking now on the summer to bring order to my mind.&#8217;
</p><p>
Indeed he didn&#8217;t start working again on the concerto before the middle 
of July while spending the summer in a small country house in Edgartown,
 Massachusetts. Here Martinu rediscovered the &#8216;order&#8217; necessary for 
creative work, and even recovered his fine sense of humour, as seen in a
 letter to his friend Rudolf Firkusny (12 July 1941): &#8216;There is quite an
 acceptable piano here which works in accordance with the 
weather&#8212;whenever it is nice weather, it works, but during that time I am
 on the beach. When it is rainy and wet, it does not work at all.&#8217; This 
was of course an exaggeration typical of the composer, as became clear 
from his letter to Sacher written just ten days later: &#8216;I finished the 
first movement and am close to finishing the second as well; everything 
should be ready within fifteen days [&#8230;] I believe you will be pleased 
with the piece.&#8217;
</p><p>
After Martinu completed the concerto, which he dedicated &#8216;to Paul Sacher
 and his Basel Chamber Orchestra&#8217;, he made another copy for safety 
reasons and through the Swiss ambassador in the USA he sent it on 20 
August to Basel. As early as 9 September Sacher telegrammed back: &#8216;Score
 arrived, am enthusiastic about the piece.&#8217;
</p><p>
In the Concerto da camera Martinu returned once
more to his favourite concerto grosso form, which allowed
him to avoid the thematic dualism of sonata form and to concentrate on 
the constant evolution of small musical cells. The first movement, 
Moderato, poco allegro, is in variation form, with spicy harmonies that 
are quite often polytonal. The orchestral writing is transparent and 
clear with only spare use of the timpani. The second movement, Adagio, 
is reminiscent of a baroque aria, characterized by the highly dense 
polyphonic writing for the string orchestra. It anticipates Martinu&#8217;s 
development towards emotional warmth and a Dvor&#225;k-like cantabile 
quality. The piano part, with its long rhythmical values, constitutes a 
sort of cantus firmus under the rich figurative work of the orchestra 
and the solo violin. The third movement, Poco allegro, is a rondo with a
 melodically and rhythmically distinct motif related to that of the 
first movement. The orchestra is given added colour by cymbals and a 
triangle. Martinu again combines elements of concerto
grosso with lyrical cantilena close to the expressive world of Dvor&#225;k.
</p><p>
The premiere of Concerto da camera took place on 23
January 1942 in Basel with Gertrud Fl&#252;gel and the Basel Chamber 
Orchestra under Paul Sacher. Three days later Sacher telegrammed to 
Martinu: &#8216;Violin concerto accepted with enthusiasm we all thank you.&#8217; 
Because of the freshness of its musical invention, the sensual sound of 
the orchestral part and the virtuosity of the solo parts, the Concerto 
da camera is a favourite among Martinu&#8217;s instrumental concertos; it 
provides delight to both performers and listeners.
</p><p>
It was unknown until recently that Martinu later slightly simplified the
 solo violin part, probably as a result of suggestions from the American
 violinist Louis Kaufman, who describes it in his memoirs A Fiddler&#8217;s 
Tale. This version of the concerto was published by Universal Edition in
 Vienna, and is recorded here. The planned complete critical edition of 
the works of Bohuslav Martinu will include both versions of the work.
</p><p>
During the 1940s, Martinu composed at least one new
work for the violin every year: the Concerto da camera of 1941 was 
followed in 1942 by the Madrigal Sonata for flute, violin and piano, and
 a year later by the Violin
Concerto No 2. The Czech Rhapsody H307A was written at Cape Cod, South Orleans, Massachusetts, from 5 to 19
July 1945. In a letter from 10 July Martinu remarks to Milos Safr&#225;nek: 
&#8216;&#8230; it is a form I thought I would no longer write in, and I am finding 
it rather difficult.&#8217; This virtuosic composition, originally for violin 
and piano, was commissioned by the celebrated violinist Fritz Kreisler 
and is dedicated to him. As far as we know Kreisler never performed the 
piece. In fact it is difficult to imagine Kreisler, who by that time had
 reached the age of seventy, reckoning with the exceptionally difficult 
technical demands of this piece, which include double stops at
the interval of a tenth as well as rapid runs and large intervallic 
leaps. The central key of the Czech Rhapsody is B flat major, which 
appears in Martinu&#8217;s later works as a symbol of hope and happiness, 
which would fit into the atmosphere of the end of World War 2. It should
 be noted that another composition by Martinu also bears the title Czech
 Rhapsody: a cantata for baritone, chorus, orchestra and organ dating 
from 1918, also composed in the throes of a world war, dedicated to the 
Czech writer Alois Jir&#225;sek.
</p><p>
Martinu had originally intended to write this work for violin with 
orchestral accompaniment. He wrote to his friend Frank Rybka (on 24 June
 1945): &#8216;For Kreisler I&#8217;ve written a Czech Rhapsody, for the time being 
with piano.&#8217; To a certain extent, then, the existing piano part was 
really conceived as a piano reduction, which Martinu then intended to 
orchestrate. With this in mind, the Martinu Foundation commissioned the 
composer Jir&#237; Teml to orchestrate the work, which he did with the help 
of the violinist Ivan Straus. Teml&#8217;s point of reference for the 
orchestration was the stylistically similar Rhapsody concerto
for viola and orchestra, H337, composed in the spring of 1952. The 
details of the premier of the original version for violin and piano have
 not yet been tracked down; the orchestral version on this disc was 
heard for the first time at the Martinu Festival in Prague in December 
2001.
</p><p>
Although written for the same set of solo instruments as the Concerto da
 camera, the Concerto for violin, piano and orchestra H342 represents a 
completely different approach towards this medium. It was composed in 
New York from 1 December 1952 to 10 March 1953, four years after the 
communist takeover in Czechoslovakia, which prevented Martinu returning 
to his native country. This enigmatic and highly personal work, 
structurally driven by its emotional nature, probably echoes the crisis 
in the composer&#8217;s personal life, caused by the sudden breakdown in the 
summer of 1952 of his
long-term relationship with Rosalyn Barstow. We can, however, follow the
 progression of the work through the correspondence of the composer with
 Olga Schneeberger, an Italian friend. On 21 October 1952 he mentions to
 her &#8216;a well-paid commission for a concerto for violin, piano and 
orchestra&#8217;. According to his letter of 8 December (his birthday) he had 
finally started to compose the concerto: &#8216;After a week of contemplation 
on the subject I now feel in the right condition to do it.&#8217; On 17 
January 1953 he remarks that &#8216;the concerto develops well; I have already
received the first bank check for it&#8217;. After a break caused by the 
preparatory work for the television premiere of his new opera The 
Marriage on the NBC, he writes on 9 February: &#8216;I have to return to this 
concerto, which I have neglected for a while.&#8217; A month later the piece 
was finished.
</p><p>
Compared to the rather neo-Impressionistic works from this period&#8212;the 
most prominent one being the complex and dense Phantaisies symphoniques 
(Symphony No 6, H343)&#8212;the Concerto for violin, piano and orchestra 
appears to be surprisingly tonal and traditional. Its first movement, 
Poco allegro, combines neo-baroque techniques with elements of jazz. The
 toccata-like opening in D minor evokes the famous Double concerto for 
two string orchestras from 1938, and introduces a feverish ostinato 
around the basic note D. This is followed by a surprisingly Dvor&#225;k-like 
melody in the strings. The first entrance of the solo piano adopts the 
toccata of the orchestral introduction, but in E flat minor. The solo 
violin steps in, taking up the string melody of the introduction, now in
 E flat major. Throughout the middle section Martinu works with these 
two motifs. After the recapitulation a coda in E major closes the 
movement.
</p><p>
The second movement, Adagio, opens in a sort of E
minor. Though very tonal again, here the proximity to his
more typical music of that time such as The Greek Passioncan be felt, 
distinguished by sudden changes of mood as well as of the density of 
orchestral texture. It feels like a strange meditation, anticipating 
with its simplicity Martinu&#8217;s elementary folk cantata Opening of the 
Springs from 1955.
</p><p>
The solo violin enters with a variant of its theme from the first 
movement. The piano joins in with figurative passagework in C major, at 
first providing an accompanimental backdrop for an orchestral oboe solo 
and only gradually developing into a genuine solo part. A richly 
figurative cadenza for the two solo instruments is followed by a vibrant
 orchestral melody that reminds us of the composer&#8217;s Czech origins. 
Here, for the first time, the typical Juliette chord progression 
appears, a sort of plagal cadence best known from his opera Juliette 
which also appears in several other works, especially from the 1950s. 
The movement closes in an emphatic C major.
</p><p>
The opening orchestral section of the Allegro reflects
the world of Martinu&#8217;s Symphony No 4, written at the end of World War 2.
 The piano enters in C major with an optimistic variant of the 
toccata-like figuration of the first movement. Just two bars later it is
 joined by the solo violin. The second theme sounds like a highly 
unusual fusion of the expressive worlds of Dvor&#225;k&#8217;s violin concerto and 
late nineteenth-century Italian opera. Short melodic cells, however, 
refer to the neo-baroque period of Martinu. What seems at first to be a 
literal reprise is suddenly stopped after just thirteen bars by a highly
 operatic procedure: a long pause followed by an unusually dramatic, 
even tragic, entrance of the piano. It is easy to see at this point a 
sort
of Faustian dilemma (&#8216;Two souls live in my chest&#8217;), but we cannot know 
whether this was what Martinu had in mind. The dark vision is lightened 
slightly by the entrance of two clarinets and by a gradual tonal 
stabilization. Step by step the orchestra comes in. The coda is in 
Martinu&#8217;s favourite key of B flat major; it presents stretto fanfares 
from the oboes and trumpets and modulates to E minor. A chorale melody 
finally leads to the culmination in C major.
</p><p>
The premiere of the Concerto for violin, piano and orchestra took place 
on 13 November 1954 in San Antonio, performed by the concerto&#8217;s 
dedicatees, Benno and Sylvia Rabinof (violin and piano respectively), 
with the San Antonio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Victor Alessandro. 
Its success led to several further performances, and on 27 March 1957 
the Rabinofs wrote to the composer: &#8216;Your concerto becomes nobler and 
better-loved every time we play it.&#8217;
