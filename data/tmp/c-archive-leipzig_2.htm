The green Bach satchel from this year&#8217;s Leipzig 
competition continues its unexpected career as a fashion accessory in 
the Far East!  There were many admiring holiday-makers in South Taiwan, 
and at least two <i>fashionistas</i> on the beach dared to come forwards
 and ask where they could buy such an item. Clearly a new opportunity 
for the marketing department of the Bach Archiv.
