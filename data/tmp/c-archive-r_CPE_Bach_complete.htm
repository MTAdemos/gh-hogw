Two reviews of volumes of the <i>Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach: The Complete Works</i>
 project appeared in November [2006]. The aim of the project is to make
available a critical edition of the works of C. P. E. Bach; the plan is
to employ a concentrated publication schedule so that the completed
edition is ready by 2014, the 300th anniversary of Bach&#8217;s birth. For a
list of volumes now available and details on how to obtain the volumes,

&#8216;When we turn to Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach we see a figure much written
about in his own times, but less since. In his own times a great
modernist, then the thin son of a ripe father, and now? Perhaps the
dullest of all the classics&#8217;. Such a statement, written half a century
ago by Max Kenyon in an otherwise generally enlightened survey of early
keyboard instruments and their music, might cause raised eyebrows
amongst the readers of this journal, but was surely representative of a
not untypical approach to music history. Much has changed since,
however, and C. P. E. Bach has slowly begun to regain something of the
esteem in which he was held in his own time, a time when judgements were
 unaffected by the, as yet undeveloped, notion of canonical hierarchy.
</p><p>
It is refreshing to read, then, in David Schulenberg&#8217;s contribution on the composer in the excellent little volume <i>Eighteenth-Century Keyboard Music</i>,
 that &#8216;Of the elder Bach&#8217;s five sons who became professional musicians,
the most important, both for the size and for the consistent quality and
 originality of his output, is now generally acknowledged to have been
Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach&#8217;, and that amongst his works is to be found
&#8216;some of the most profound as well as some of the wittiest, most
engaging keyboard music ever written&#8217;.
</p><p>
Despite this, C. P. E. Bach has not been fortunate when it comes to
modern scholarly editions. The previous attempt at a complete works, the
 <i>Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach Edition</i>, under the editorship of
Rachel W. Wade and E. Eugene Helm and published by OUP, was begun in the
 1980s but only ever issued four volumes, now out of print; and, as
noted in the last BCS Newsletter in the announcement for the volume
under review, Mikl&#243;s Sp&#225;nyi&#8217;s edition of the keyboard music has also run
 aground. There has been, it is true, a complete facsimile version of
the keyboard works edited by Darrell Berg, though this is difficult to
track down; and many of the keyboard works have appeared in modern
editions of varying quality (the ABRSM Selected Keyboard Works edited by
 Howard Ferguson, though far from complete and not exactly scholarly,
has always seemed to me useful). Nonetheless, and especially in the
light of the recovery in 1999 of the archives of the Berlin
Singakademie, this particular Bach is long overdue for a scholarly
critical edition of his works, and this is a timely and laudable
venture, due for completion in 2014, the tercentenary of the composer&#8217;s
birth.
</p><p>
This project, under the auspices of the Packard Humanities Institute,
has a distinguished editorial board, including, among other well-known
scholar-musicians, Christopher Hogwood, Darrell Berg, Christoph Wolff
and Peter Wollny. The editor of this volume, David Schulenberg, is, as
we have already seen, a tremendous advocate for the keyboard music of C.
 P. E. Bach, and he brings to the task not only enthusiasm but also an
encyclopaedic knowledge of the music, its compositional contexts and its
 sources.
</p><p>
The works contained in this volume are some of the most approachable of
all of Bach&#8217;s compositions for the keyboard, though they are not, as
Schulenberg repeatedly points out, always as easy as their titles might
imply. The <i>Achtzehm Probe-St&#252;cke in Sechs Sonaten</i> (Wq. 63/1&#8211;6)
were, of course, written to accompany and illustrate the <i>Versuch</i>
 published in 1753. These sonatas, unusually, though not uniquely in
Bach&#8217;s works, do not maintain a single key within each work, though the
keys are related: for example, the three movements of Sonata IV are in B
 minor, D major and F sharp minor (incidentally, it is the use of such
remote keys that contributes, according to Schulenberg, to the
difficulty of these movements, especially, he says, on the clavichord).
These sonatas are placed first in this volume, and appearing at the end
are the <i>Sechs Neue Clavier-St&#252;cke</i> (Wq. 63/7&#8211;12). These six short
single-movement sonatas were written in 1786 and published the following
 year as part of an expanded musical supplement to the third edition of
the <i>Versuch</i>. Despite their discrete published appearance,
Schulenberg presents evidence that they may have been viewed as
constituting two three-movement works in the same form as the first six
sonatas: certainly the sequence of tempi would support this, and the key
 relationships do not make it implausible.
</p><p>
The <i>Sechs Leichte Clavier-Sonaten</i> (Wq. 53) of 1766 constitute the
 last set of sonatas published by Bach while he was in Berlin. These
predominately two-part works are not, says Schulenberg in the
introduction to this volume, &#8216;especially easy by the prevailing
standards of the day&#8217;. However, varied and embellished readings for four
 of the movements from these sonatas are contained in a manuscript,
catalogued as Wq. 68. This manuscript contains only those parts of the
music varied or embellished: Schulenberg therefore presents composite
versions of these movements (separately from, and in addition to, their
published form) in which the varied and embellished movements are merged
 with the published form to produce a complete, performable text. This
provides a fascinating insight into the process of varying given
material, something Bach discussed in the <i>Versuch</i> particularly with reference to repeats, and which he illustrated elsewhere (the third movement of Wq. 53/5 or the two sets of <i>Reprisen</i> sonatas, for example).
</p><p>
The other works contained in this volume are the <i>Six Sonates pour le Clavecin
&#224; l&#8217;usage des Dames</i>
 (Wq. 54). Though composed in 1766, while Bach was still in Berlin, they
 were not published until about 1770, when he had been in Hamburg for
several years. Schulenberg suggests that the [unusually] inaccurate and
imprecise nature of this edition, issued by Hummel in Amsterdam, implies
 that Bach may not have been as closely involved in its production as
was his usual practice.
</p><p>
In addition to the project preface from the editorial board and a series
 preface by Darrell Berg, David Schulenberg provides a lengthy and
thoroughly detailed introduction to the volume. In sections dedicated to
 each of the four sets of sonatas included he describes the
compositional and publishing history and contexts, as well as discussing
 the musical forms and styles employed, all in a scrupulously documented
 and footnoted form. Of particular use is a passage in the section on
the <i>Probest&#252;cke</i> where are listed all the references to these works that occur in the main body of the <i>Versuch</i>.
 He concludes with a brief section on performance practice which touches
 (as also does Berg&#8217;s general preface to the keyboard works) on the
precise status of the clavichord as the intended medium for Bach&#8217;s
music; discusses the appropriateness of additional ornamentation; and
refers to ambiguities in the text in relation to the application of
dynamics, and to the durational values of some notes in inner voices.
</p><p>
The critical report, amounting to some 40 pages of the 190 in the main
body of the volume, is a treasury of information. Like the introduction
it is split up into sections on each work. Each section lists and fully
describes all early sources &#8212; the many manuscript copies, of varying
authority, and the printed copies, both authorized and pirated. These
are presented in groups: autograph and other manuscripts used for the
edition, prints used for the edition, manuscripts not used for the
edition and early prints not used for the edition. For the printed
sources used Schulenberg lists all exemplars seen.
</p><p>
After an evaluation of the sources there follows a detailed listing,
firstly of changes made by Bach prior to publication and variants
between printings (where applicable), and secondly of editorial
emendations to the text. Bach&#8217;s active involvement in the publishing of
his works is referred to frequently in this volume, and can be followed
in great detail in Stephen Clark&#8217;s edition of his letters. Consequently
the original texts are generally both detailed and accurate, and
editorial emendations are relatively few. All are carefully explained
and apt. I did notice one slip, though: on page 189 in the notes on
Sonata I (Wq. 63/7) we are told that the seventh note of the top stave
of bar 13 has been changed to an e2 and the reasons for the change are
explained; however, unlike all similar emendations there is no
indication of the reading given in the source. A very small slip in such
 a volume, but it does reinforce for all of us Bach&#8217;s own frequent pleas
 to Breitkopf on the subject of proofreading: for example, he writes in a
 marginal note in one letter &#8216;Tell your proof-readers ... that if they
deprive me of my honour through the slightest mistake, then they would
deserve nothing better than to be taken to Waldheim [a prison in
Saxony]&#8217;.
</p><p>
This is a beautifully produced volume, about the same large size as the
abortive OUP edition and like it bound in blue cloth. Whereas the OUP
volumes had a gold silhouette of Bach as the emblem on the front cover
this new edition uses a gold print of Bach&#8217;s own autograph harmonization
 of his surname in an album of C. F. Cramer. The paper is of a very good
 quality, the musical print (even in the heavily ornamented, annotated
and fingered <i>Probest&#252;cke</i>) and text are splendidly clear, and this
 book is altogether a delight to pick up and use. Perhaps this very
quality makes it a little heavy for some music desks, and I have one
small quibble concerning layout: it is a shame when three consecutive
two-page movements, as in Sonata IV (Wq. 63/4), all require page turns.
</p><p>
These are only tiny issues, however. This is an outstanding volume in an
 excellent venture, and, at $25 for direct sales, quite unbelievably
good value. One can only wish such a praiseworthy project well and look
forward to future volumes of the same high standard of scholarship and
production.

Following the sad demise of the C. P. E. Bach Edition begun so promisingly by Oxford University
Press in 1989 under the direction of Eugene Helm and Rachel Wade, the collected works of C. P. E.
Bach are newly launched in this handsomely produced set of volumes by the Packard Humanities
Institute, in co-operation with the Bach-Archiv, Leipzig, the S&#228;chsische Akademie der
Wissenschaften zu Leipzig, and Harvard University. It is good to see that a collected edition is
once again a real possibility for this composer. The new editorial team includes such established
Bach scholars as Darrell M. Berg  General Editor, together with Ulrich Leisinger and Peter Wollny
and David Schulenberg.

</p><p>
Schulenberg has edited vol.I/3  keyboard music  to a generally very high standard,
particularly as regards the provision of source information, although I have some reservations about his editing of the musical text. The contents form a generous musical offering: the volume contains
not only the three sets of keyboard sonatas mentioned on the cover and title-page, but also a further set of pieces, the <i>Sechs neue Clavier-St&#252;cke  VI Sonatine nuove </i> which
accompanied the Versuch in its third edition of 1787, and which are here labelled as &#8216;Wq 63/7 12&#8217;. The other three sets comprise the <i>Aehtzehn Probest&#252;cke in Sechs
Sonaten</i>, originally issued to complement the <i>Versuch</i> in 1753  &#8216;Wq 63/1 6&#8217;, the <i>Sechs leichte ClavierSonaten</i>  &#8216;Wq 53/1 6&#8217;, and the
<i>Six Sonates pour le Clavecin &#224; l&#8217;usage des Dames</i>  &#8216;Wq 54/1 6&#8217;. The general editors have expressly retained the old Wotquenne numbering, used here virtually
exclusively. Wotquenne&#8217;s thematic catalogue was superseded by Helm&#8217;s much more extensive and nuanced listing published in 1989  and provisionally available before that in the <i>New
Grove 2</i>. The Helm catalogue [H] numbering has generally taken precedence in the literature on C. P. E. Bach since, and could have been expected to be used here. The rationale behind the
adherence to Wotquenne is explained by the editors simply by reason of its sheer persistence: &#8216;Alfred Wotquenne&#8217;s Thematisches Verzeichnis...  1905  has long been the standard catalogue
of Bach&#8217;s works, and the present edition employs Wotquenne numbers... for primary references to Bach&#8217;s work&#8217;  general preface to all volumes, although H numbers do put in an
appearance here and there, and are to be found among the small print in the critical commentary.
</p><p>
It could be argued that the ideal way to access C. P. E. Bach&#8217;s keyboard music
would be directly from Darrell Berg&#8217;s facsimile editions of the various original manuscript and printed sources  New York: Garland, 1985. The added value of a modern edition such as this must
lie in its presenting the musical text in a carefully considered form for the present-day reader, and in the extent of the contextual information it provides. On this latter count, Schulenberg&#8217;s
edition scores highly, with, besides its nearly 150 pages of musical text, some 50 pages of introductory prose and commentary, presenting the fruits of his searching scholarly enquiry.
</p><p>
My reservations about the editorial approach concern the suppression of certain features of the original, in particular C. P. E. Bach&#8217;s detailed dynamic markings. Bach is quite precise about
where, and in which part, and on which note, the dynamic markings should apply. As Hans-G&#252;nter Ottenberg has observed, &#8216;Here more than anywhere else in his keyboard music, Bach has notated
in great detail his exact requirements&#8217;  <i>C. P. E. Bach</i>, trans. Philip Whitmore  Oxford, 1987, p.78. Schulenberg suppresses some of this detail as a matter of policy, subsuming it
under a single marking or omitting it altogether, and sometimes thereby distorting what seem to be the original intentions. This happens even where a linear texture is strongly characterized, either by
contrapuntal working-out or through the combination of distinctive melody and accompaniment lines. To give just two instances: in the <i>Probest&#252;cke</i>, Sonata III, first movement, bars 16
17, the canonic imitation at a bar&#8217;s distance is marked in Schulenberg&#8217;s edition with a single <i>forte</i> indication on the first quaver of the &#8216;dux&#8217; in bar 16;
no further marking is given. In fact Bach marked the right hand &#8216;comes&#8217; entry with a forte on its first quaver. In <i>Probest&#252;cke</i>, Sonata I, second movement, bar 9, in
this edition the syncopated melody is correctly marked <i>piano</i>, but the bass part entering on beat 2 with an elegant accompanying figure is left unmarked; Bach had a piano on its first
crotchet.  The same happens with the pianissimo sequential repetition beginning at bar 13.  Howard Ferguson, in his Associated Board edition of the <i>Probest&#252;cke</i>, agrees with me on
this point. He consistently retains the original placing of dynamics in left and right hands  and I find his bold-type, italicized dynamics easier to take in visually. Ferguson&#8217;s edition scores
less well, though, in regard to Bach&#8217;s fingering: here it is Schulenberg who presents the more comprehensive rendering of this aspect of the original.

</p><p>
The presentation of the
musical text itself seems virtually error-free, although there are occasional small slips: bar 21 in <i>Probest&#252;cke</i>, Sonata III, second movement should be numbered 22, and is there a
fingering missing in Sonatina VI in D minor  p.148, bar 14, RH on d&#8217;? The Probest&#252;cke  the most substantial of the sonatas here  conclude with the famous &#8216;Hamlet&#8217; Fantasy,
H 75; Helm&#8217;s catalogue lists over 25 items in the literature on this work  and more have appeared since. Less well known but often cited in discussions of their genre are the attractive
&#8216;Damen-Sonaten&#8217;; belonging to the 18th- and 19th-century proliferation of &#8216;music for ladies&#8217;, these could all too easily be dismissed as simple, deliberately undemanding
pieces. At times they resemble Mozart in K545 vein  see Sonata I, bars 9ff.. I have, though, heard the suggestion made  at a C. P. E. Bach conference  that these works show an enhanced
<i>empfindsam</i> character, in keeping with female sensibilities  simultaneous cross-relations are a speciality: see, for instance, Sonata VI, second movement, bar 7. These sonatas are not
lacking in C. P. E. Bach&#8217;s characteristic twists and turns; as a collection they display a variety of keyboard textures and moods, including the humorous effects for which the composer is
renowned.
</p><p>
Besides the general preface common to all three volumes, setting out the editorial policy for the whole project, each series has its own generic preface  by Darrell Berg on
keyboard music, and Peter Wollny on symphonies and concertos. These provide an overview that will be especially helpful for those relatively unfamiliar with C. P. E. Bach&#8217;s work. Also among the
preliminary material are sections of plates featuring facsimiles of title-pages and pages from manuscript and printed sources. The prefaces to the individual volumes cover matters of compositional
genesis and publication history, performance history and reception, performance practice, and musical style. What emerges from them collectively is, above all, a strong sense of C. P. E. Bach&#8217;s
high profile as a composer in his own time, of his successful and astute management of his professional career  for example in cultivating and negotiating with publishers, and of the appreciative
reception of his music despite &#8212; in fact, because of &#8212; its pronounced individualism: he was recognized in his own time as an &#8216;original genius&#8217;.

</p><p>
Another
important aspect that emerges strongly is his consideration of &#8216;Kenner und Liebhaber&#8217; &#8212; connoisseurs and amateurs &#8212; with the carefully contrived appeal to either or both
of these categories in designing and marketing his published collections. An advertisement for the <i>Sei Concerti per il cembalo concertato</i>, H471 6 of 1772, possibly originating with Bach
himself  see vol.II/8, p.xi, declared: &#8216;To connoisseurs of good music that comes from the heart and to friends of natural rather than muddled and foolish tastes, these concertos certainly will
be desirable.&#8217; Such words both flattered and instructed the potential buyer, while also stressing the pieces&#8217; suitability for the amateur, &#8216;the solo part as well as the
accompaniments&#8217; being &#8216;easier&#8217; and the cadenzas written out. As the editor, Douglas A. Lee, reminds us, with these works Bach was contributing to a relatively new genre. In them
Bach explored the relationship of solo and orchestra that was at the heart of the late 18th-century keyboard concerto. Thus the entries of the harpsichord soloist following the opening ritornellos
display a variety of strategies. In Concerto I the soloist enters immediately after the ritornello as part of a dialogue with the orchestra  to which the opening idea lends itself, with its forte-piano
contrasts. In Concerto V the soloist is absent from the slow introduction  except of course for the customary continuo function, and enters in the following Presto, introduced unaccompanied for maximum
exposure, whereas in Concerto II the opening Allegro di molto for orchestra is followed by an Andante section with the soloist entering virtually unaccompanied before the Allegro di molto resumes  the
alternation of these two tempi recurs later. Concertos IV and VI have the solo part entering with varied versions of the opening idea, the latter a more-or-less literal use, the former constituting an
expressive decorative variation. In Concerto III the solo part entering at bar 33 features a reflection in improvisatory style, taking its departure from the ritornello material. The set as a whole
shows experiments with structure and key  for example, in the through-composed form of Concerto V, with all four sections based in the tonic G major, the first three being open-ended, and in the use of
open-ended movement-structures and interesting key-juxtapositions within the three-movement cycles of the other five concertos.

</p><p>
Similar experiments characterize the four orchestral symphonies, the <i>Vier Orchester-Sinfonien
mit zw&#246;lf obligaten Stimmen</i>, H663 6, of 1775&#8211;6, edited here by David Kidger. These symphonies
are the crown of Bach&#8217;s work in this field. Again, the genre was relatively new, and
Bach&#8217;s major contribution to it in these works  as well as in the earlier set of Six String
Symphonies, H657 62, commissioned by van Swieten perhaps shows his originality at its most
striking. The extreme quirkiness with which he handles symphonic gestures &#8212; themselves still a
novelty &#8212; renders them even more novel: the opening of the very first symphony, in D major,
immediately establishes this with its unexpected &#8216;take&#8217; on the conventions. The expanded
wind section is used colourfully and with a new independence. These four symphonies deserve to be
adopted into the regular concert repertory  their premi&#232;re in Hamburg was a triumph, as Kidger
documents. In fact they sustained a presence in the repertory long after Bach&#8217;s lifetime.
Peter Wollny points out  vol.II/8, Preface: Symphonies, p.x  that they were &#8216;issued and
revived in the concert hall on a number of occasions in the 19th and early 20th centuries and are
thus the only symphonies from Bach&#8217;s generation&#8217; to have the distinction of claiming
&#8216;a continuous performing tradition running from his era to ours&#8217;.

</p><p>
Christopher Hogwood  chair of the editorial board  and his colleagues are to be congratulated on their sterling efforts on behalf of a composer once described in
<i>Early Music</i>, xviii  1990  as &#8216;still one of music&#8217;s half-knowns&#8217;, and one who definitely deserves to be much better known and appreciated. Or as Bach&#8217;s
friend Charles Burney put it, &#8216;it must be owned that the style of this author is so uncommon,
that a little habit is necessary for the enjoyment of it&#8217;.</p>
