Christopher's 'gentle authority' of direction is 'the lasting memory' of an 'enthralling' <i>Arianna</i> performed at the Barbican on May 17 and to be heard on BBC Radio 3 at 2pm on September 24.

<b><i>Arianna</i> at the Barbican<br>

 of the success stories of the Barbican's 'Great Performers' series over
 the past three years has been the Academy of Ancient Music's 
exploration of lesser-known Handel operas (directed by Christopher 
Hogwood), one from each decade (<i>Amadigi</i>, then <i>Flavio, re de' Langobardi</i>),
 and intended as a build-up to this anniversary. Lesser-known operas are
 generally lesser-known for a reason, and this was no exception. 
Although it is unlikely to make a Handel top-ten, it nonetheless has 
some spectacular vocal numbers, no doubt intended to show off Handel's 
singers. Miah Persson and Kristina Hammarstr&#246;m were outstanding in the 
roles of Arianna and Teseo, the latter having some particularly agile 
vocal writing to cope with. Inevitably, we had the Barbican curse of 
having a 'big-name' singer pull out (do they actually <u>book</u> these 
singers?), although, equally inevitably, I found myself impressed by the
 replacement, in this case Marina de Liso (as Tauride), as I also was 
with Sonia Prina. Bass Antonio Abete spent most of the evening being 
naughty, which he did very well. As with the two previous AAM/Barbican 
operas, it was the direction of Christopher Hogwood that will be the 
lasting memory. The AAM is one of those orchestras which in recent times
 have adopted what for me is a rather forced and pushy style of playing,
 so it was refreshing to have direction from a conductor with gentle 
authority who devoted his energy to allowing the music to flow, without 
stooping to the antics of some of his younger colleagues. Although, in 
theory, their performance of <i>Arianna in Creta</i> (17 May) was the 
last of the series, I hope that the AAM and their Emeritus Director 
remain regular visitors to the Barbican. Unusually for my concert 
reviews, readers will be able to decide if I am talking nonsense as this
 concert will be broadcast as part of the BBC Radio 3 Handel opera 
series on 24 September at 2pm. I hope you find it as enthralling as I 
did.</p>
