A recent trip to Leipzig to conduct the <a href="http://www.gewandhaus.de/gwh.site,postext,history-gewandhausorchester.html">Gewandhaus Orchestra</a>
 resulted in a number of interesting discoveries for Christopher, in 
addition to a fine week's music-making and an excellent live broadcast 
of the programme.

In addition to learning that the orchestra had recently played Christopher's new edition of Mendelssohn's <i>Reformation</i>
 Symphony on tour in China (where the newly discovered fourth movement 
was well received), he was also presented with a copy of a recent Decca 
recording made by the orchestra under Maestro Chailly which included his
 B&#228;renreiter edition of the early (1830) version of Mendelssohn's <i>Hebrides</i>
 Overture &#8212; a world premiere recording of this version, played by the 
orchestra of which Mendelssohn himself was once Music Director.

And, as a gastronomic footnote, after disappointingly discovering that 
the fine restaurant which he had previously recommended on visits to 
Leipzig (<i>Medici</i>) had changed hands, he was relieved to find that 
the whole team had simply moved to a larger venue, and were now called 
MACIS (Markgrafenstrasse 10, 04109 Leipzig, phone: +49 341 22 28 75 20) 
adjacent to an enormous organic supermarket and serving totally organic 
meals, including mineral waters and some fine wines all with impeccable <i>biologische</i> credentials. Still highly recommended.</p>
