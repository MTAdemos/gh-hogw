 Eberl was held in high regard by his contemporaries, the Allgemeine 
Musikalische Zeitung commenting in 1807 that seldom had the death of an 
artist been so widely regretted. Nine years Mozart&#8217;s junior, Eberl also 
began life as a prodigy, giving his first Viennese recitals at the age 
of eight. Mozart was Eberl&#8217;s friend and probably also his teacher; his 
compositions show a great acquaintance with Mozart&#8217;s style which led to 
repeated misattribution of his own works. 
</p><p>
In his chamber music Eberl broke away from the more conventional 
formats, and employed unusual instrumental combinations, such as a 
quintet for piano, oboe and strings, in 1806 (Edition HH 176), in 1808 a
 quintet for piano, clarinet and strings (Op.41), and also a sextet for 
piano, clarinet, horn and strings.

There were few precedents for works for solo cello and piano with a 
fully written out keyboard part, as opposed to the more familiar cello 
with continuo accompaniment. The two Op.5 sonatas for cello and piano by
 Beethoven were published in 1796, followed by several sets of 
variations, and Mozart left only a fragment of an Andantino for cello 
and piano. For this combination, Eberl first published Variations sur un
 theme russe, Op.17 in 1802 and followed with the Grand Duo, Op.26 in 
1804. 
</p><p>
The Grand Duo creates an entirely new formal scheme for this 
combination: where a minuet or scherzo would normally be expected,  
Eberl  substitutes the more innovative Rhapsodie; the finale is an 
elegant and unprecedented Pastorale movement, with episodes in in 
varying metres. The Duo&#8217;s scoring is impressive throughout, with Eberl 
maintaining a clear balance between the cello and piano contribution, 
with the cello alternating between high-set melodic lines, powerful 
arpeggio figuration and the more traditional doubling of the piano&#8217;s 
bass-line.

Eberl also provided an alternative string part for violin, a carefully 
revised transposition which will be of interest to both cellist and 
violinist. The violin version contains many markings which either 
contradict, or, more usefully, supplement, those in the cello part. Both
 string parts have been included In the present edition, and markings 
from the violin version pertinent to the cello have been added 
editorially; however individual players may wish to explore further the 
differences between the two parts.</p>
