 concert-overture &#8220;Ruy Blas&#8220;, the fourth in B&#228;renreiter&#8217;s series of 
Great Mendelssohn Overtures in Urtext editions, was composed in 1839 for
 a performance in Leipzig of Victor Hugo&#8217;s play (1838) of the same name.
 Mendelssohn&#8217;s effective overture calls for four horns and three 
trombones giving it the largest orchestral forces of his concert 
overtures.
</p><p>
Mendelssohn claimed to have written the overture in 24 hours and had the
 parts copied just in time for rehearsals and the first performance a 
few days later. As with many Mendelssohn compositions, &#8220;Ruy Blas&#8220; has 
come down to us in more than one version.
</p><p>
The new B&#228;renreiter Urtext edition presents Mendelssohn&#8217;s autograph 
score of the first version and the final version (here published for the
 first time) back to back. The new edition contains an informative 
introduction and a detailed critical commentary with facsimile examples 
of the sources.</p>
