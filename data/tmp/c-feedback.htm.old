  Dear Mr.Hogwood,<br>
  <br>
  I love your outstanding work on Mozart's Clarinet and Oboe concertos
  played by Antony Pay and Michael Piguet. Its a landmark work. The
  concertos are so mesmerizing, soul lifting and memorable that I have
  been hearing them repeatedly for last 20 years yet can't get enough of
  them. <br>
  <br>
  You brought the music of Mozart to life. <br>

  Dear Mr Hogwood,<br>

  When I purchased my first CD player, way back in 1984, I purchased with
  it just two CDs to start me off. They were two Handel works, by yourself
   conducting the AAM, though at the time I was new to 'classical' music
  and had not heard of the of the orchestra. Since then you and the
  Academy have given me the greatest musical pleasure that I have ever
  had.<br>

  Dear Mr. Hogwood,<br>
   <br>
  Sorry for my poor English (I am French and absolutely not a musician, only a music-lover and an enthusiastic of Beethoven).<br>
  It is already a long time that I wished to give you this feedback about
  Beethoven Complete Symphonies with The Academy of Ancient Music (AAM)
  which, at time of their first release (about 1985), did not receive the
  merited acknowledgement (at the least in France!).<br>
   <br>
  For me, your Interpretation with the AAM is absolutely unequaled.  I
  often compared with other noteworthy records and I came always to the
  same conclusion: your tempi, your accentuations, the highest level of
  the musicians, the unity of the orchestra,  the nuances, the shade and
  globally your vision of these outstanding works from classical
  repertoire, situate these recordings at the top of the top. <br>
  I have the complete collection in the original release from L'Oiseau
  Lyre which offers additionally the famous and natural DECCA-sound. <br>
  In other words, my selection for the lonely Island.<br>
  It is always with great excitement that I place these fantastic CDs on my Naim player.<br>
   <br>
  Naturally I possess other CDs from AAM which bring me always huge exaltation.<br>
   <br>
  Thank you very much for your fantastic work, all the pleasure and immeasurable emotion you bring to all classical music lovers.<br>
   <br>
  Sincerely yours,<br>
   <br>

  One of Christopher Hogwood's most useful editing projects has been his
  series of the chamber versions of Haydn's twelve London symphonies,
  'ingeniously contracted' by Salomon for string quartet, flute and piano.
   Haydn enthusiasts near London have the chance to hear a performance of
  this version of Symphony 101 ('The Clock') at King's Place on 25th June
  given by RAM students, directed by Trevor Pinnock.<br>
  <br>
  In a piece of enterprising programming, the other work on offer is Erwin Stein's fifteen-player arrangement of Mahler 4.

  I own and very much enjoy your three clavichord "Secret" albums (Handel,

  "Secret Beethoven," but I have been unable to find it--on this site, or

  I just watched your London "Dido" and was much moved by the performance:
   the singing and orchestra were stunning, and even the dance - of which I
   generally am not a fan, unless it's authentic Renaissance and Baroque -
   incorporated some Baroque gestures. I did like the idea of conjoined
  witches and they accomodated one another very well.  Dido's final aria
  was paced perfectly and as always, I am in awe of singers who can droop
  down and die on stage, have it look natural and sing beautifully.
  Jonathan Miller would be pleased: no operatic histrionics.  The entire
  piece was well-conceived and kept me enthralled throughout.  Thank you
  for your work.  Patricia Yeiser, Syracuse, New York, USA

  I was just listening to Egarr's version of Handel's Opus 3 and as fine

  Congratulations on the conclusion of the Handel opera cycle. The
  performance I heard last night at the Barbican was dazzlingly sung, with
   beautifully articulated playing from the Academy. Christopher Hogwood's
   hint in his Birmingham Post interview (see News page) that we might see
   some Handel from the 1740s is an enticing prospect indeed.

  Dear Mr Hogwood:<br><br>

  As to your letter to The Times, I don't recall that particular
  Ciceronian conceit:  perhaps  our magistra didn't wish to call our
  attention to the frivolous nature of the Orations. We were, after all,
  mere adolescents with wandering minds.  On the other hand, it was her
  habit to go into the hall and summon latecomers to class using Classical
   Latin.  It was an effective use of the Imperative.  <br><br>

  Dear Christopher Hogwood,<br><br><br>
  here is just a quick note to say *Thank You* for your wonderful work.<br>
  <br>
  I'm a composer and performer of electroacoustic music with a deep love
  for early music. My search for players who seem to really open a window
  to those days has lead me to the Academy of Ancient Music and your
  colleagues of the Consort of Musicke. What can I say, listening to your
  recordings sometimes makes it even harder to find some quality time to
  work on my things! But I certaily don't regret as your music is such a
  wonderful source of inspiration. Especially your recordings of William
  Byrds "My Ladye Nevells Booke" are such a joy to listen to over, over
  and over again.
  <br><br>
  Although I'm not a skilled keyboard player in any way myself I started
  a project called 'Virginals' two years ago. This is dedicated to
  interpretation and early instruments, I'm performing special versions
  of compositions by contemporary composers Alvin Lucier, Phill Niblock
  and Francisco Lopez on an Ottavino built by Arnold Dolmetsch and a set
  of four mechanical gramophones. A CD with this material will be
  released by the end of the year on the London based 'Touch' label and
  it would be my great pleasure to send you a copy once this is finished.
  I didn't mean to bother you with any questions with this very
  spontaneous message, but as the Virginals project is also dedicated to
  you it would be very kind if you want to give me an address where i may
  send a CD to.
  <br><br>
  In the end I meant to say thank you for the outstanding work!
  <br><br>
  With the very best wishes<br>
  - Stephan

  Dear Maestro Hogwood,<br>
  <br>
  I just wanted to thank you for (quickly) responding to my e-mail two
  months ago and suggesting early works that are good for the low voice.<br>
  I wanted to you to know that because of hard work and a little bit of
  tenacity, I am already performing a concert here in New York City,
  singing Bach's Cantatas Nos. 208 and 212,  Purcell's Come ye Sons of Art
   (Birthday Ode for Queen Mary) and H&#195;&#164;ndel's Ode for the Birthday of
  Queen Ann.  As I told you in my last e-mail, for the last couple of
  years I have been dying to do oratorios and early music instead of
  singing just opera.  I'm now finally getting that chance.  I have also
  begun working on Messiah and Elijah.<br>
  Again, thank you for your help and I wish you a successful and busy 2009.<br>

  Thank you very much for posting the interviews with Mark Wiggins. In
  particular, Christopher Hogwood's reference to the BBC's ambitious
  recording schedule brought to mind a couple of ambitious projects with
  the Academy in the early eighties: Telemann's Der Messias and Benda's
  melodrama Medea. The latter featured an incandescent performance by
  Barbara Jefford in the title role. O, to be able to hear it again!

  Hi...<br>
  I'm a professionnal chamber violinist, now in pension, but spent my life
   performing music from middle-age till contemporary, and as much as
  possible following the conventions of the time (for instance, I never
  played Prokofieff on a barok fiddle !).<br>
  <br>
  I started investigating on Baroque since 1967 (reading many old texts), but on my own, since at the time I was in South Africa.<br>
  <br>
  Later (1977) I extended that research till Mozart, and, soon after (1980) till Beethoven and early 19th.<br>
  As much for the instrumental tech as for the playing conventions...<br>
  <br>
  I must say that since your publication of the Mozart symphonies, I do
  admire very much your production in that line, and am totally confident
  in it, even before to listen to it.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, I'd like to ask a question concerning a detail that I thought to be without any doubt or uncertainty: the trill.<br>
  <br>
  According to all texts I read, Quantz, Corette, L'abb&#195;&#169; le fils,
  Geminiani, Tartini, Couperin, etc... It always has to start with the top
   appogiature (to create an expressive dissonnance), the only tiny
  exception I know on that , is KPE Bach, in what he calls "Prall
  Triller", but only concerning very fast passages, where others would in
  fact only do an appogiature.<br>
  <br>
  Of course, I mean that all this applies from the beginning of the 17th
  century, and to exactly 1825... in the 16th, trills where not that much
  in use, and anyway had a different meaning, and, as for that date 1825
  that may seem a bit arbitrary, it is just according to Hummel, who said
  in the preface of his piano method:<br>
  "I know that the trills have to be always started with the top note, but
   I think it should be started on the note itself..." and then he spend a
   half page explaining why and how... and knowing that his method had a
  very fast fame, in the next 5  years, everybody was following his advice
   (but that did brobably not affect Beethoven nor Schubert who died in
  the next 2 or 3 years after).<br>
  <br>
  Any way, my question is:<br>
  more and more among  todays players (I mean the baroque so called
  specialists, and not even speaking of fakes like Biondi or Melkus), one
  hears trills played like romantic trills... even if the rest of the
  recordings seems close to the proper style (correct ornements, correct
  speeds, and so on)...<br>
  <br>
  the first instance of such a thing was by a German conductor Reinhart
  Goebel, in a Bach overture, in the famous air, where the improvised
  ornaments were OK, but all the trills were started "alla Romantica"...
  even, there was there a text from Goebels to explain why he did so (but I
   must confess that it did not really convinced me)... later, I had a
  very well played recording of Scarlatti sonatas by Andrea Stair, where
  he, some times, did the same... also a recording of Biber sonatas, but
  the violinist was a pupil from Goebels, so...<br>
  <br>
  More recently, I came across Your recording of Mozart concerto for flute
   &amp; harp, and the soloists are doing the same... so, I hope I finally
   will have the answer to that question, and I'm prepaired to change my
  mind (if the arguments seem valid enough though)...<br>
  <br>
  Thanks for reading all that, and I hope answering to it...<br>

  I have the first 10 volumes of your exceptional work of Haydn's complete

  By the way, I'm truly very fond of Martinu's Double Violin Concerto.<br>
  <br>
  I'd really rather not hear the first half bar of it, however, whenever I come to check Christopher Hogwood's concert itinerary.<br>

  Dear Mr Hogwood, <br>
  <br>
  Many thanks to you and Hyperion for making me very happy today. I have
  waited twenty years for a CD recording of Martinu's lovely Double
  Concerto for Violin &amp; Piano. It seems that Supraphon never saw fit
  to re-issue their recording which I owned on LP. No matter now that you
  have given us this splendid new recording which I hope will win the
  composer many new friends.<br>
  <br>
  If you ever have some Czech singers at your disposal and the support of
  an enterprising record label - please, please, please consider another
  Martinu rarity, the enchanting Cantata 'Kytice ' (Bouquet).

  Dear Mr.Hogwood, I am trying to obtain a DVD of a performance by youself
  of Dido and Aenaes by Henry Purcell. This is for my grandson who needs
  it for his studies. I believe it was produced by Ms Kirby. As expected by
   a teenager he has given me little time to obtain the DVD. Hoping for a
  speedy response,Yours Vic St.Denis

  Dear Mr. Hogwood: <br>
  At the suggestion of your website (I loathe computereese) I read your
  column in The Guardian (November 2003) about  arbitrary shifting of
  intervals in opera.  It reminded me of a section in Dorothy L. Sayers's
  "Murder Must Advertise":  Lord Peter Wimsey is explaining the niceties
  of language  required  in the labeling of products, and describes the
  distinctions among with, from and chiefly, necessary to avoid litigation
   for libel.  Perhaps productions to which directors (and in the
  USA,union scene-shifters) have taken, if not the hatchet, then the paper
   cutter, should be advertised thus: "La Clemenza di Tito," with parts by
   Mozart; "Orlando," from Handel; or " The Cunning Little Vixen," chiefly
   by Janacek.  In any case, I enjoyed your column, which I assume is
  predominantly by Hogwood.<br>
  Yours sincerely, Patricia Yeiser, Syracuse, New York  U.S.A.<br>
   Add.  Chorus on toilets?  How extremely tacky and more to the point, not Historically Informed.

  I am trying to locate a Christmas CD that I lost and I do not have much
  information to go by.  I know the conductor was Christopher Hogwood, it
  was recorded in a church in England with a chorus and consisted
  primarily of Christmas songs.<br>
  <br>
  Would love to purchase somewhere if you can help.<br>
  <br>
  Thanks.

  Dear Mr. Christopher Hogwood! <br>
  <br>
  I`m your fan from Russia. I was in your concert in Madrid (february,
  2007) and was happy to listen to your performance of Mendelsohn symphony.
   I was impressed very much by your conducting. There is a intelligent
  group in Perm State University (Russia) that supports your views on the
  music and the way of performance. Sorry, the modern musical culture
  lives in crisis, and we can hear the ancient music only by the
  recordings. I know any time ago you visited Russia and played the
  concert, and even now it`s discussed among the Russian musicians. Thank
  you very much for your great work. I hope you`ll visit Russia more. My
  intent is to write that the Russians love you. <br>
  Sincerely yours, <br>
  Andrew Borisoff

  Dear Mr. Hogwood, and the Hogwood-Community:<br>
  <br>
  I am quite excited to see such a new window here inviting anyone who see
   this site, who have questions and are interested in the information to
  have their spaces. <br>
  <br>
  Among several updated versions of the web-site, I think I like this one
  the most. This is strikingly clear, and well managed. The colour themes
  in the site is really tasteful. Here, as someone who had visited the
  office and received kind help from the "community", could I suggest you
  put on the portrait and have a part in the site for the people get to
  know you? It would be nice to know more from the team, and surely better
   for the people to know whom to contact while we need help.<br>
  <br>
  Sincerely,<br>
