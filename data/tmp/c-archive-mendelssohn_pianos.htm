On
 16th November Oehms released Christopher's recording of Felix 
Mendelssohn Bartholdy's Concertos for 2 Pianos and Orchestra, with The 
Silver Garburg Piano Duo and the bayerische kammerphilharmonie. It is 
excellent to have this CD available so rapidly, it only having being 
recorded in June of this year. 
</p><p>
Mendelssohn is an often underestimated composer - Florian Olters in the 
sleeve notes describes how many find him "too sugary, too smooth, even 
too polished" - and these concertos are not often recorded, but Sivan 
Silver and Gil Garburg feel that he needs to be reappraised. Christopher
 is of a similar conviction, noting how Mendelssohn wrote the two 
concertos, with their complex textures and tone colours, when he was 
still a teenager.
</p><p>
The Duo specifically picked the bayerische kammerphilharmonie as they 
had worked previously with them on a tour and been very impressed. 
Christopher was delighted with their decision and very much enjoyed 
working with this excellent chamber ensemble.</p>
