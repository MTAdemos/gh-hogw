 Handel&#8217;s music for the Hanoverian court was, by the very nature of the 
events &#8212; weddings, birthdays, funerals, coronations &#8212; occasional music, 
and none more so than the <i>Music for the Royal Fireworks</i> of 1749. 
It was played only once in the form that Handel first planned, and even 
that event (apart from the music, about which nothing was reported) was 
declared a failure; both the treaty it celebrated and the actual 
pyrotechnics turned out to be, if not damp squibs, dangerously 
compromised.
</p><p>
The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (present-day Aachen) was devised to bring 
to an end the War of the Austrian Succession, a squabble for colonial 
power largely played out between England and France &#8212; in America the 
conflict is still referred to as &#8216;King George&#8217;s War&#8217;. Many of its 
conditions were unfavourable to Britain, who, by agreeing to return to 
the <i>status quo ante bellum</i>, had to give up strategic trading 
positions in Nova Scotia and Gibraltar. On the other hand Madras was 
given back, and at the same time the succession of the House of Hanover 
in Great Britain was confirmed, so that dynastically if not 
commercially, the King could be persuaded to see it as a triumph. But 
the public called it capitulation, and were fiercely critical of the 
government. Horace Walpole summarised the situation in a letter to 
Horace Mann (24 October 1748): &#8216;The Peace is signed between us, France, 
and Holland, but does not give the least joy; the stocks do not rise, 
and the merchants are unsatisfied ... in short, there has not been the 
least symptom of public rejoicing; but the government is to give a 
magnificent firework&#8217;.
</p><p>
The first plan proposed fireworks &#8216;to be play&#8217;d off before the D[uke] of
 Newcastle&#8217;s house in Lincoln&#8217;s Inn-field&#8217; in October 1748, but this 
celebration was postponed, to give time for grander preparations, extra 
spin, enhanced connection with the King rather than his politicians, a 
larger public attendance and, possibly, better weather. The site chosen 
was the fashionable upper part of St James&#8217;s Park, recently improved at 
the Queen&#8217;s instigation, which was becoming separately known as Green 
Park. It was a short walk from Buckingham House (not yet Palace) and was
 overlooked by the Queen&#8217;s Library, designed by William Kent. Ground was
 broken in early November and a military fence (&#8216;a double row of chevaux
 de frize&#8217;) guarded by musketeers was erected to prevent public access.
</p><p>
The Green Park Machine was a theatrical contrivance, its design and 
operation in the hands of technicians imported from France and Italy. 
The Chevalier Servandoni (originally Jean-Nicholas Servan), designer of 
the Machine was, according to Diderot, &#8216;grand machiniste, grand 
architect, bon peintre et sublime d&#233;corateur&#8217;. He had previously worked 
for the King&#8217;s Theatre as a scene painter for Handel&#8217;s operas during the
 1720s, and for the fireworks he devised &#8216;a magnificent Doric Temple&#8217; in
 best <i>trompe-l&#8217;oeil</i> style:
</p><p class="quote">
<i>Tho&#8217; the materials were only wood, and canvas white-wash&#8217;d and siz&#8217;d,
 it appeared in great elegance, like a temple of fine stone, with a 
balustrade on the top, except in the center [sic], where instead of a 
pediment, it went strait up in order to receive some pictures and the 
king&#8217;s arms, to the top of which it was 114 foot high, and being adorned
 with statues and other figures, festoons of flowers, and other lustres,
 gave great delight to the beholders, which were innumerable. From this 
temple, which was 144 feet in length, extended, by 5 arches of a side 
two low wings, north and south, at the end of each a pavilion, the whole
 length being 410 feet. The several prints published, not excepting that
 by authority, of this structure, did not agree with the appearance on 
the night of performance. (The Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine, vol. 19 (April, 
1749), p. 186)</i>
</p><p>
The official <i>Description</i>, whatever its faults, is our best source
 for a description of the &#8216;Inscriptions, Statues, Allegorical Pictures, 
&amp;c.&#8217; which decorated the Machine and the transparent pictures which 
were to be lit from within. The actual fireworks were to be devised and 
controlled by Gaeta no Ruggieri and Giuseppe Sarti, both from Bologna. 
The Ruggieri family represent one of the longest-surviving dynasties in 
the pyrotechnical trade, firing the celebrations for the French 
Revolution, and still around to supervise the display in New York 
harbour when the Statue of Liberty was rededicated in 1986. Working in 
collaboration with the Royal Laboratory at Woolwich, they planned for an
 estimated 10,000 rockets and other devices to be let off, culminating 
in the grand Sun on the top of the Machine, supposed to burn for five 
hours with &#8216;VIVAT REX&#8217; in its centre in &#8216;bright Fire&#8217;.
</p><p>
Engravings of the promised structure and descriptions of &#8216;the <i>intended</i> Fireworks&#8217; were printed, most of them unofficial, together with rumours of an impressively large band of military music:

</p><p class="quote">
<i>The band of musick that is to perform at the fireworks in the 
green-park, is to consist of 40 trumpets, 20 French horns, 16 hautboys, 
16 bassoons, 8 pair of kettle-drums, 12 side-drums, a proper number of 
flutes and fifes; with 100 cannon to go off singly at intervals, with 
the musick. See the VIEW of the fireworks in our Magazine for December 
last. (The London Magazine, 14 January 1749)</i>
</p><p>
In the caption to that engraving Handel&#8217;s name is mentioned for the 
first time: &#8216;a Band of a Hundred Musicians are to play before ye Fire 
works begin, the Musick for wch is to be compos&#8217;d by M.r Handel&#8217;, from 
which we might assume that the composer was aware of the proposed 
instrumentation and had agreed to write for it. But Handel&#8217;s inclusion 
in the scheme, if not actually an afterthought, appears to have been 
rather delayed. This may have been the fault of his own diary rather 
than official procrastination, and probably some bargaining was involved
 over what was musically possible in terms of the massed military 
instruments already promised. His impatience with bureaucracy is easily 
understandable and comes across vividly in the letters that passed 
between those officials who had the job of dealing with him &#8212; the Duke 
of Montagu, Master General of the Ordnance and the highly-strung Charles
 Frederick, grandly titled &#8216;Comptroller of His Majesty&#8217;s Fireworks as 
well as for War as for Triumph&#8217;.
</p><p>
They first encountered problems persuading Handel to hold a public 
rehearsal in Vauxhall Gardens and to include as many military 
instruments as the King hoped to see:
</p><p class="quote">
<i>Duke of Montagu to Charles Frederick (28 March 1749)</i>
</p><p class="quote">
<i>I don&#8217;t see any kind of objection to the rehersal of the musick at 
Voxhall being advertised, and when that is done, if any questions are 
asked how it comes to be there, the true reason must be given.
</i></p><p class="quote"><i>
I think Hendel now proposes to have but 12 trumpets and 12 French horns;
 at first there was to have been sixteen of each, and I remember I told 
the King so, who, at that time, objected to their being any musick; but,
 when I told him the quantity and nomber of martial musick there was to 
be, he was better satisfied, and said he hoped there would be no fidles.
 Now Hendel proposes to lessen the nomber of trumpets, &amp;c, and to 
have violeens. I don&#8217;t at all doubt but when the King hears it he will 
be very much displeased. If the thing war to be in such a manner as 
certainly to please the King, it ought to consist of no kind of 
instruments but martial instruments. Any other I am sure will put him 
out of humour, therefore I am shure it behoves Hendel to have as many 
trumpets, and other martial instruments, as possible, tho he don&#8217;t 
retrench the violins, which I think he shoud, tho I beleeve he will 
never be persuaded to do it. I mention this as I have very lately been 
told, from very good authority, that the King has, within this 
fortnight, expressed himself to this purpose.</i>
</p><p>
Although it is always assumed that Handel did not want to rehearse in 
Vauxhall for logistical reasons &#8212; and surely the full band would not 
have fitted into the &#8216;Music Box&#8217; &#8212; the fact that the event was to be 
publicly &#8216;advertised&#8217; (and the Gardens to make a fine profit from 
tickets) may have been the true cause. Handel not only wanted the music 
new for the event, he had recently engaged to repeat the Fireworks Music
 as part of a charity concert at the Foundling Hospital four weeks 
afterwards, and would not have wanted to lessen the pulling power of 
this programme.
</p><p>
The argument over the instrumentation may perhaps be reduced to a 
conflict between professionals (Servandoni, Handel) and amateurs 
(Frederick, Montagu) in the business of dramatic and musical 
presentation. Starting from the musically obvious, we can easily surmise
 that Handel realized three important factors from the very beginning. 
Firstly, the originally publicised &#8216;military&#8217; forces could never have 
played together: 40 trumpets against 16 oboes could not have been 
contained in a single composition, since the brass would have entirely 
out-balanced the winds; more probably a series of marches contrasted 
with fanfares had been envisaged. Montagu reported that the next level 
proposed was 16 trumpets and 16 horns, and that these were reduced to 12
 of each (and eventually 9). Perhaps the simplest explanation is that 
there were not enough extra military players who could read music; army 
personnel usually played from memory. Handel was simply biding his time 
as the figures decreased.
</p><p>
<img class="imgright" src="upload/firew-paint.jpg">In
 the second place, any work written for such an extraordinary band would
 have had no future after its premiere. Handel may have been reminded of
 this by his publisher, John Walsh, but certainly the prospect of 
publication as well as the benefit for the Foundling Hospital must have 
encouraged the incorporation of the strings. Thirdly, Handel surely 
realised that no other local composer would, at this stage, be competent
 to provide the necessary score. Years of experience with theatrical 
negotiations would have suggested to Handel that he allow Mr Frederick, 
clearly a musical innocent, a glimpse of the manuscript showing strings,
 and use that as leverage to reduce the unworkable numbers of brass. He 
would offer to eliminate the strings, which would have made no effect in
 Green Park anyway, in exchange for a manageable number of military 
instrumentalists who could read music. Meanwhile he continued to 
indicate in the manuscript where string parts would be needed at the 
Found ling Hospital and also continued to resist the idea of a public 
rehearsal at Vauxhall:
</p><p class="quote">
<i>Duke of Montagu to Charles Frederick (9 April)</i>
</p><p class="quote">
<i>Sir, &#8212; In answer to Mr. Hendel&#8217;s letter to you (which by the stile of
 it I am shure is impossible to be of his indicting) I can say no more 
but this, that this morning at court the King did me the honor to talke 
to me conserning the fireworks, and in the course of the conversation 
his Majesty was pleased to aske me when Mr. Hendel&#8217;s overture was to be 
rehersed; I told his Majesty I really coud not say anything conserning 
it from the difficulty Mr. Hendel made about it, for that the master of 
Voxhall, having offered to lend us all his lanterns, lamps, &amp;c. to 
the value of seven hundred pounds, whereby we woud save just so much 
money to the office of Ordnance, besides thirty of his servants to 
assist in the illuminations, upon condition that Mr. Hendel&#8217;s overture 
shoud be rehersed at Voxhall, Mr. Hendel has hetherto refused to let it 
be at Foxhall, which his Majesty seemed to think he was in the wrong of;
 and I am shure I think him extreamly so, and extreamly indifferent 
whether we have his overture or not, for it may very easily be suplyd by
 another, and I shall have the satisfaction that his Majesty will know 
the reason why we have it not; therefore, as Mr. Hendel knows the 
reason, and the great benefit and saving it will be to the publick to 
have the rehersal at Voxhall, if he continues to express his zeal for 
his Majesty&#8217;s service by doing what is so contrary to it, in not letting
 the rehersal be there, I shall intirely give over any further thoughts 
of his overture and shall take care to have an other.</i>
</p><p>
Handel evidently conceded the Vauxhall rehearsal which was eventually 
fixed for 21 April at 11 am; there was also a preliminary rehearsal at 
Handel&#8217;s house in Brook Street on the 17th which we presume (for the 
sake of the neighbours) only involved some of the principal players. The
 full Vauxhall show attracted &#8216;the brightest and most numerous Assembly 
ever known... an audience of above 12,000 persons (tickets 2s. 6d.)&#8217;. 
Westminster Bridge, so recently built, was already closed for subsidence
 repairs making a traffic jam on the old London Bridge inevitable 2 and 
provoking some bad behaviour: &#8216;So great a resort occasioned such a 
stoppage on <i>London-Bridge</i>, that no carriage could pass for 3 
hours; &#8212; The footmen were so numerous as to obstruct the passage, so 
that a Scuffle happen&#8217;d, in which some gentle men were wounded&#8217; (<i>The Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine</i>,
 April 1749, p. 185). Normal entry to Vauxhall was a shilling; at the 
elevated price of 2/6, 12,000 people at 2/6 a ticket, if the number were
 true, would have yielded a more than tidy profit for the manager, 
Jonathan Tyers of over &#163;1,500. But the figure is physically impossible; 
allowing for normal means of transport &#8212; foot, carriage, boat &#8212; it was 
possibly 2&#8211;3,000 (or even a misprint for 1&#8211;2,000?). Since, this was 
still a high-priced event.
</p><p>
The Royal Artillery Train again loaned Handel their timpani from the Tower, as they had for <i>Joshua</i>, but more surprising are the 36 pounds of explosive delivered to Mr Frederick at Vauxhall.
</p><p>
Was this for incidental salutes to be added to the rehearsal, and, if 
so, they may in fact have been included within the composition, as one 
description states (&#8216;After a grand Overture of Warlike Instruments, 
composed by <i>Mr. Handel</i>, in which eighteen small Cannon were fired...&#8217;). Certainly 36 pounds of gunpowder divides nicely amongst 18 cannon.
</p><p>
In spite of the (over-estimated) number of people at the public 
rehearsal, no description of Handel&#8217;s music appears in any report of the
 event, either public or private. The same neglect has to be admitted 
for the actual show itself, where the numbers were even greater, but the
 music still marginalised by the spectacle and its incidental disasters.
 While it was still light, the King, his son &#8216;Butcher&#8217; Cumberland and 
the court toured the Machine, and presented purses to the operatives.
</p><p class="quote">
<i>The whole Band of Musick (which began to play soon after 6 o&#8217;clock) 
perform&#8217;d at his Majesty&#8217;s coming and going, and during his stay in the 
Machine.
</i></p><p class="quote"><i>
At half an hour after eight, the works were begun by a single rocket 
from before the library, then the cannon within the chevaux de frize 
were fired; two rockets were afterwards discharg&#8217;d at the front camera 
of the inclosure, when 101 pieces of cannon placed on Constitution-hill,
 were discharged; after which a great number of rockets of different 
sorts, balloons, &amp;c. were discharged, to surprising perfection. (The
 Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine, p. 186)</i>
</p><p>
The official <i>Description</i> shows that the display was planned in a 
series of eleven numbered scenes, each containing multiple firings and a
 set piece. (A second version &#8212; <i>Description II</i> &#8212; published after the event was rewritten to describe what actually happened). <i>The Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine</i>,
 noting &#8216;all kinds of artists, affecting to make use of foreign words 
and phrases, rather than the common terms&#8217;, obligingly translated the 
technical names:
</p><p class="quote">
HONORARY ROCKETS are the large rockets which are fired single... As all 
fireworks are considered as compliments to princes or great persons, the
 French have given the name of <i>fusees d&#8217;honneur</i> to these rockets, which are constantly the beginning of every firework.
</p><p class="quote">
AIR BALLOONS, are hollow globes of paper filled with stars, &amp;c. 
which are fired from mortars, and are contrived to burst when at their 
greatest altitude; some of the balloons fired on this occasion were 
remarkably fine. CADCEUS ROCKETS and GIRANDOLE ROCKETS. These had a 
circulating motion as they rose.
</p><p class="quote">
TOURBILLONS, are copied from the Chinese. They consist of a case of 
composition which rises not endways, like a rocket, but keeps horizontal
 in its ascent, and is contrived to turn round at the same time with a 
horizontal motion. &#8212; Some of these were very pleasing by their 
complicated movement....
</p><p>
However, the surprising perfection did not last:
</p><p class="quote">
<i>About half an Hour after Nine, in discharging some of the works from 
the Pavilion at the Left Wing of the Building, it set Fire to the same, 
and burnt with great Fury, so that that, and two of the Arches, were 
burnt to the Ground; and had not the Carpenters made a Breach by casting
 away two Arches, and removing the Timber, and for the Assistance of 
some Fire-Engines which were in Readiness, in all Probability the whole 
Fabric would have been consumed. Messengers were going to and from his 
Majesty all the Time of this Misfortune; and when it was brought under, a
 Present was made to the most diligent in stopping the Flames.
</i></p><p class="quote"><i>
During the Fire, the grand Rockets and the Sun were discharged; but this
 Accident prevented the exhibiting some of the most considerable of the 
Fireworks.
</i></p><p class="quote"><i>
About Eleven the whole Building was illuminated, and continued so until 
between Two and Three o&#8217;Clock. His Majesty and the Royal Family withdrew
 about Twelve. (Description II, p. 8).</i>
</p><p>
From eyewitness accounts of the evening, we learn that despite &#8216;a dark 
overcast of cloudiness&#8217; (John Byrom) the rain held off, the ladies were 
shocked by the explosions &#8212; Jemima, Marchioness Grey reports that &#8216;the 
Number, the Sizes &amp; various Forms of the Rockets were quite 
surprising, one Explosion particularly which they say was of Six 
Thousand was beyond all Imagination, &amp; excepting to poor Mrs. Talbot
 who was frightened out of all her Wits (for it was not indeed a very 
Quiet Amusement) they were no less Beautiful&#8217; &#8212; but most people agreed 
with Horace Walpole that &#8216;the rockets and whatever was thrown up into 
the air succeeded mighty well, but the wheels and all that was to 
compose the principal part, were pitiful and ill-conducted, with no 
changes of coloured fires and shapes: the illumination was mean, and 
lighted so slowly that scare anybody had patience to wait the 
finishing&#8217;.
</p><p>
In spite of mishaps, the whole show lasted some nine hours. Even a 
tantrum from the designer, the last thing Mr Frederick needed, was 
quickly sorted out. When the pavilion caught fire, Servandoni drew his 
sword on Frederick; he was disarmed and taken into custody, but released
 the following day after apologizing. At the end the sun, &#8216;32 feet in 
Diameter&#8217; and the literal high-light of the scheme, survived to fulfil 
expectations. But nowhere is there any comment on the musical 
contribution; for this, our only document is Handel&#8217;s score.
