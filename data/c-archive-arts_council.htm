In a letter to The Times on 22 January 2008, Christopher joined other
top British early music performers in opposing the Arts Council's moves
to withdraw funding from the Early Music Network. The letter is copied
below, but you may also access it online.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p><p>

</p><p>
<i>Sir, One of the 194 organisations threatened with the withdrawal of
its grant by Arts Council England is the Early Music Network. British
musicians have long led the world in the historically informed
performance of Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque music, and the EMN has
been a vital advocate and facilitator in this field since 1977. If it is
 now abandoned, more than 100 concerts around the country each year
would not happen. Nor would a biennial showcase providing a platform for
 innovative and emerging ensembles, and a competition for young
performers. The network has helped to develop the careers of most of
Britain's top early music performers, has helped to lever up to ten
times its own Arts Council grant from other funders, and has acted as a
model for similar structures in other European countries - all at an
annual cost to the taxpayer that is less than the salary of one GP. Arts
 Council England would be wilfully negligent not to reconsider this.<br>
