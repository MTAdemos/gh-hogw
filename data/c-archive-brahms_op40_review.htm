 Ashworth writes: "it came as a huge surprise and pleasure to receive 
for review a copy of the new B&#228;renreiter Urtext edition by Christopher 
Hogwood." He goes on to praise the publication, describing it as "a 
handsome, 'luxury' edition [with] ease of page turns, [...] excellent 
editorial suggestions, [...] and the print itself so beautiful and 
clear."

</p><p>
He enjoys the "copious historical notes of great interest", and makes a 
point of mentioning Christopher's "several sensible suggestions of 
dynamics and phrasing that may have been missed in the original Simrock 
edition, which answer some of the small questions usually arising out of
 rehearsals of this work." 

</p><p>
The review concludes: "particularly with all of the additional 
historical information, I'm sure that this reasonably priced publication
 will find many friends and admirers [&#8230;] this is a superb new edition of
 possibly the horn fraternity's greatest piece of chamber music."
