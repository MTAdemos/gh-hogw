Few people would go to Venice primarily for the food (and until recently
 the food has always seemed to be a reason for not going there &#8212; too 
much polenta and too many touristic menus).
</p><p>
But if you are there and needing food after a concert, there are still 
fairly few places of resort. The Ristorante al Teatro, immediately 
beside the front door of the Fenice Theatre is one possibility, and for a
 curious selection of early Italian recipes (17th and 18th century) Le 
Bistrot de Venise keeps its kitchens open until 1 am.

If your aim is to avoid places too openly directed at the tourist trade 
(and cheaper than the Danieli, Harry&#8217;s Bar and similar) I did notice 
that many gondoliers seem to patronise the Ristorante da Raffaele (very 
close the nice small Hotel do Pozzi, only a stone&#8217;s throw from St Mark&#8217;s
 Square).

A little further, and beyond Rialto I was taken to a very small and 
overlookable restaurant by the leader of the Fenice Orchestra and Andrea
 Marcon, called:
</p><p class="quote">
Trattoria Tre Spiedi<br>
SS. Apostoli &#8212; Cannaregio 5906<br>
tel: 041 520 8035<br>
closed &#8220;Sunday afternoon&#8221; (i.e. lunch) and Monday
</p><p>
You tend to be told what you will eat and drink (&#8220;Prosecco? No, you can 
have white wine and mineral water!&#8221;) but the food and atmosphere are 
excellent and completely tourist- and music-free.
</p><p>
Since there are so may possibilities in Venice, and half the fun is 
getting lost and discovering things, I would only recommend one new food
 guide, which is free from any commercial pressures, called 
(inelegantly) <i>A Guide to the Eateries of Venice</i> by Michela 
Scibilia consisting of short descriptions and pictures of places that 
she and her friends (including, I notice, Jonathan Del Mar) have found 
exceptional; also, at the end, a charming glossary of Venetian food 
words which are sometimes very different from &#8220;mainland&#8221; Italian.
</p><p>
Otherwise all you will need is J. G. Links&#8217; <i>Venice for Pleasure</i>, which, as Bernard Levin said, is &#8220;Not only the best guide-book to that city ever written, but the best guide-book to <i>any</i> city ever written&#8221;</p>
