<img class="imgright" src="upload/enigma.jpg">Christopher&#8217;s Urtext edition of Elgar&#8217;s <i>Enigma Variations</i> has attracted attention from an unexpected source, <i>Early Music Review</i>,
 in which Clifford Bartlett both reviews the edition (&#8216;Rather more 
modern than we usually review!&#8217; he admits) and features it in his 
editorial on performance practice. The reason for this special notice is
 the edition&#8217;s unusually rich pool of evidence relating to the 
performance of the work, evidence (such as contemporaneous annotations 
and recordings) that is as pertinent &#8212; and, arguably, more useful &#8212; to 
performers as the composer&#8217;s markings in the score.

Editorial and review by Clifford Bartlett from <i>Early Music Review</i> 129 (February 2009):
</p><p>
<b>Editorial</b>, p. 1
</p><p>
Are you one of those people who always have a sharpened pencil at the 
ready at rehearsal (with a spare in pocket or handbag), and smother your
 music with squiggles? Or do you concentrate on what the conductor says 
and try to remember it (as well as your own unmentioned mistakes)? 
Whatever one&#8217;s inclination, one should follow the expectation of the 
conductor. With an <i>ad hoc</i> ensemble and a rushed rehearsal, there 
is no alternative but to keep the pencil busy. But for an ensemble of 
any sort working regularly with a director, there should be a stylistic 
understanding that only requires the unexpected to be marked. The less 
the music has to be looked at, the more the performers can communicate 
with each other and the audience.
</p><p>
Those who have studied performance material from the &#8216;early&#8217; period 
(let&#8217;s say before 1800) will affirm that the sort of pencil markings 
that we make didn&#8217;t exist. Furthermore, performance instructions such as
 those given by more modern composers for dynamics, phrasing, etc. 
rarely exist either, and certainly not in such profusion as in some 
editions of early music or in more recent music. I&#8217;ve been looking 
recently at B&#228;renreiter&#8217;s fascinating new edition of Elgar&#8217;s <i>Enigma Variations</i>
 (see below). In the first six bars of the violin 1 part there are 24 
notes (each bar begins with a rest, followed in alternate bars by 2 
quavers and 2 crotchets or 2 crotchets and 2 quavers). Every pair of 
crotchets is slurred, each quaver has a horizontal accent line. There 
are 5 dynamic marks and 2 ten[utos]. There is also an <i>Andante</i> at the beginning plus <i>legato e sostenuto</i> and <i>p molto espress</i>
 specifically for vln 1. Any well-used orchestral part will also have 
some bowings. Does all this tell players unfamiliar with Elgar much 
about how to play it? Probably not. And does repeating the information 
each time the phrase comes help? Wouldn&#8217;t we like to have metronome 
marks to give us Bach&#8217;s tempos! But beware, Nimrod initially varied 
between crotchet = 66 and 72, the 1902 reprint of the score slowed it to
 52, but in 1920 Elgar started his recording at 48, in 1926 at 46 (so 
early recording were taken fast to fit on a side of a disc!) speeding up
 to 56. Do what I say, or do what I do? For Bach, we don&#8217;t have many 
examples of the latter. Ultimately what matters is the performers&#8217; 
understanding of the music, which is achieved by study, experience, 
insight and fashion.

<b>Elgar Variations on an Original Theme for Orchestra Op. 36 &#187;Enigma&#171;  
Edited by Christopher Hogwood B&#228;renreiter (BA 9042), 2007. xxxiv + 
142pp, &#163;68.00</b>

Rather more modern than we usually review!  However, I mentioned this in
 my editorial, and it is worth considering further. This is a completely
 new score (the editor reckons there are 3,000 amendments to the old 
one), and the expiration of the copyright under the 70-year rule enables
 the parts to be sold as well (they have only been available on hire for
 the last sixty years).  Sensibly, the pagination and rehearsal numbers 
are the same, though the inclusion of the original ending on p. 117 
displaces the remaining pages.[<a href="#fn1">1</a>] (This ending was used for Ashton&#8217;s 
ballet.) A useful addition is that the variation number is shown in 
Roman numbers at the top of every page: why do scores not normally have 
running titles?
</p><p>
Elgar was lucky to have a good editor at Novello, Jaeger (Nimrod), and 
was himself a more thorough proof-reader than many composers. But the 
thorough critical commentary shows that some details were missed, and 
one merit of the edition is that it sorts out so many minor 
inconsistencies between score and parts. The introduction points out 
some ways in which the understanding of some of the notational symbols 
have changed in the last century &#8212; the meaning of the accent signs, for 
instance. But with a work performed and recorded for over thirty years 
by the composer, there are developments that undermine the idea of a 
fixed text. The tempi, for instance, changed; perhaps now it was a 
classic, they could be exaggerated a bit, just as they tend to become 
more extreme in competing recordings of baroque classics. The footnote 
added to Variation VIII (WN) in 1949 suggesting that Elgar reached the 
metronome mark by dividing by two rather than by three is questioned in 
the introduction, though I don&#8217;t quite follow the argument.
</p><p>
The introduction focuses more than usual on evidence related to 
performing the work. Trying to reconstruct a tradition after a century 
of gradual changes is hazardous, but with a well-known and greatly-loved
 work like this, I suspect that there is still a lot of evidence around;
 the introduction itself quotes a publication of 1975. The scores of 
older conductors and old sets of parts should be checked (the BBC must 
have useful evidence, if any scholar can get at it), and there are 
surely individual enthusiasts who annotated their copies, though the 
value of such evidence must be carefully weighed.[<a href="#fn2">2</a>]

[1] There is no indication on p. 116 that to perform the usual ending, 
p. 117 is omitted. (We know from &#8216;He shall feed his flock&#8217; that, however
 well you know a piece, skipping a page can cause problems.) Conductors 
are likely to smother p.117 with pencil crossings so are unlikely to 
give the original ending an occasional hearing; the Introduction 
suggests that Elgar had reservations about the extended version.

[2] For instance, I've pencilled into my miniature score a [<i>p</i>] at
 the beginning of the last chord of No. IV, though don't know why. A 
quarter-century ago, I bought from Brian Jordan a group of miniature 
scores that had belonged to Dorabella (Variation X). Sadly the <i>Enigma Variations</i> score was a late printing and quite unmarked; 
her copy of contemporary <i>Verkl&#228;rte Nacht</i> contained a list of performances she had heard.</p>
