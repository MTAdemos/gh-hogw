    <p>
The lecture was part of a series of lectures and concerts, "European Capitals of Music":<br>
"Famous musical capitals provide the framework for this series of 
lectures with live music. The first three concentrate not only on 19th 
century Vienna, but on Schubert in Vienna and writing chamber music. Why
 did this music happen then, where was it played, who provoked, 
preformed and paid for it. And was it considered successful?"<br>

 by Eleanor Corr (violin), Xin Xin Liu (viola), Hannah Rose Innes
