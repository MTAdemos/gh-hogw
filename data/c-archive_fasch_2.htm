<img src="upload/fasch-cover.jpg" alt="fasch-cover.jpg" class="imgleft" height="497" width="350">The
 second volume of keyboard music by the reclusive Carl Fasch contains 
two unpublished sonatas (one in the unusual key of B flat minor) and his
 considerable output of &#8220;character pieces&#8221;, short descriptive works 
which justify contemporary opinion that he was the true successor to C. 
P. E. Bach. These individual vignettes are ideal for playing on either 
the clavichord or the fortepiano and provide an expressive foil to the 
first volume&#8217;s more extended and extrovert sonatas.
