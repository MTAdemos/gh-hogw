Variations on an Original Theme for Orchestra, Op.&nbsp;36 'Enigma'<br>
B&#228;renreiter BA9042</b>
</p><p>
Christopher's eagerly awaited edition of Elgar's Enigma Variations is now available!
</p><p>
Edward Elgar&#8217;s popular Enigma Variations, composed between 1898-99 is a 
collection of variations on an original theme - each of the variations 
is dedicated to one of his close friends - or as Elgar himself put it: 
&#187;Dedicated to my Friends Pictured Within&#171;. 
</p><p>
Christopher's new Urtext edition makes use of all known source material 
including the early sketches, autograph score and the revised text from 
1904. The new edition clarifies discrepancies between the score and 
reprintings of the orchestral material while also documenting Elgar&#8217;s 
revisions. The edition contains the original ending to the Intermezzo 
(Variation X) as well as the original ending to the last variation.
