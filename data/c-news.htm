Kirchner (1823-1903) was a celebrated pianist, organist and composer in 
his own right. His particular affinity with Brahms' music and his 
aptitude for arranging it were widely recognised, not least by Brahms 
himself, and the two were close friends from their first meeting in 1865
 until Brahms' death in 1897. </p><p>After the initial appearance of Brahms' string sextet Op. 18 in 1861, 
the publisher Simrock commissioned several versions of the work adapted 
for more practicable forces, including this 1883 arrangement for piano 
trio, which, according to Brahms, Kirchner had "executed superbly". 
Relieved by his approval, Kirchner told Brahms that his sextet in its 
new form "would be a welcome gift for trio players".</p><p>Christopher's edition, which takes into account differences between 
Simrock's score and often more accurate parts, includes an Introduction 
outlining the personal and professional relationship between Brahms and 
Kirchner, a full Critical Commentary, and facsimiles from both the 
original sextet and the trio arrangement. <a href="https://www.baerenreiter.com/en/search/product/?artNo=TP419" class="bluelink">Christopher's edition of the sextet</a> was published by B&#228;renreiter in 2011.</p><div class="imgcenter"><img style="height: auto; width: auto;" src="upload/op-18-trio-arr.jpg"><div style="display: none;" class="caption CanNotDelete" contenteditable="false"><br></div></div><p></p><p></p><p></p>

continues his series of three string quartets by Czech composer V&#225;clav Pichl (1741-1805).</div>
<p>
Admired by Haydn, and preferred over Mozart for the position of music 
director to Archduke Ferdinand d'Este, governor of Lombardy, on the 
recommendation of Maria Theresa, V&#225;clav Pichl wrote over 900 works, 
including 30 string quartets. The present set of three quartets, Op. 13,
 published in Berlin in 1788, was dedicated to Carl von Dittersdorf, who
 in 1770 had secured his "best friend" Pichl a valuable position in 
Vienna that he held until his departure for the archduke's court in 
1777. <br></p><p></p>

<div style="display: none;" class="caption CanNotDelete" contenteditable="false"></div></div><br>
<p>
</p><p>These stylish and skilfully contrasted works exploit all four 
instruments equally (even the viola is allocated elaborate solo 
passages) and offer an attractive alternative to the standard Viennese 
works of this period. Haydn himself requested that Pichl's "new 
quartets" be copied out for performance in Esterh&#225;za in 1780.
</p>
As with the

with an Introduction, full Critical Commentary, and facsimiles from the

Having touched upon the subject in Rules for Playing in a True Taste Op. 8 (1748) and A Treatise of Good Taste in the Art of Musick (1749),
 Geminiani provided keyboard players with three versions of a treatise 
on the creation and performance of accompaniments from figured and 
unfigured basses. Its first manifestation, appearing in French in 1754 
under the title L'Art de bien Accompagner, was revised and expanded for the publication of full-length versions in English and (despite an Italian title-page) French as The Art of Accompaniament and Arte d'Accompagnare, each issued as Op. 11 and in two parts in 1756-7. </p><p></p>
<div style="width:260px;" class="imgright"><img src="upload/gemin-w260.jpg" width="260"><div style="display: none;" class="caption CanNotDelete" contenteditable="false"></div></div><p>Throughout the treatise in all its forms, Geminiani provides firm rules 
for the correct realisation of harmonies and particularly the 
preparation and resolution of discords, but he also insists that the ear
 must be the judge of what is acceptable and that players must adapt 
their style of realisation to suit the composition to hand. His music 
examples correspondingly demonstrate a range of possible solutions to a 
succession of harmonic progressions increasing in complexity from a 
single root-position chord to passages as long as a sonata movement. 

</p><p></p><p>While in each 18th-century publication the word-text was printed at the 
front of the volume and thus separated from the engraved music-text 
behind, in the new edition words and music are interspersed so that 
Geminiani's remarks can be read alongside the music examples to which 
they relate. Moreover, the verbal texts from all three original 
editions, which regularly offer different perspectives on the same 
point, are transcribed in parallel columns for comparison.</p>

<p>The music examples themselves are reproduced in facsimile to preserve 
the niceties of Geminiani's idiomatic notation, which includes notes 
with strokes through their tails, tail-less note-heads and other devices
 intended to demonstrate without words the notes' various harmonic 
functions.

Presumably having started life as a concerto for the standard Baroque forces of flute, strings and continuo, this <i>Concerto a Quadro</i>,
 now otherwise unknown, is preserved in its surviving form for flute, 
violin, viola and cello in a set of manuscript parts apparently copied 
by a Swedish amateur musician in the 1760s and now part of Christopher's
 collection. Although unlikely to be the work of Handel, as a rare early
 example of music for flute quartet it is an attractive extension to a 
repertoire otherwise dominated by the works of Mozart and his 
contemporaries. 

</p><p>
In the present publication, editorial figuring in the cello part allows 
for the possibility of expanding the texture with additional continuo 
instruments, and the edition is complemented by an Introduction, 
Critical Commentary and facsimiles from the manuscript parts.

The cover image is a reproduction of <i>Playing in Parts</i> (1801) by 
James Gillray (1756&#8211;1815), a hand-coloured etching based on a 
watercolour of the same name by Brownlow North (1778&#8211;1829) showing only 
the central trio of violin, cello and fortepiano; Gillray's design is 
much altered and elaborated by the addition of several other figures 
including two flautists reading from the score and a dog, who appears to
 have commandeered all the separate parts. From the collection of 
Christopher Hogwood.</p>

    <div class="leader">
In celebration of its pioneering early music and period performance label, <i>L'Oiseau-Lyre</i>,
 Decca has released a box-set entitled "L'Oiseau-Lyre: The Baroque Era"
containing 50 CDs of recordings originally released in the Florilegium
series. 37 of these CDs are recordings made by Christopher with the
Academy of Ancient Music.

This proliferation of Christopher's recordings is testimony to his remarkable contribution to <i>L'Oiseau Lyre</i>'s
 success. The set features music by English, German, French and Italian
composers of the Baroque era, with Christopher's recordings appearing in
 each of these categories. A full list of the repertoire and performers
on each CD can be found on <a href="http://www.deccaclassics.com/gb/cat/4786753">Decca's</a>
listing for the set, along with audio snippets of each track.
</p><p>
The music ranges from such popular favourites as Vivaldi's The Four
Seasons and Handel's Water Music, to lesser-known gems including a
delightful pairing of Rebel's <i>Les El&#233;mens</i> and Destouches's <i>Les El&#233;ments</i>.
 Of particular note is CD 26, Christopher's recording of J.C. Bach's
orchestral overtures, which has never previously been released on CD.

</p><p>
The box set includes a booklet with two specially-commissioned essays
for the set: 'The repertoire' by Lindsay Kemp, and 'The L'Oiseau-Lyre
story' by Raymond McGill. This is the first of three such limited
edition box sets of <i>L'Oiseau-Lyre</i> recordings to be released by Decca, with sets
for the Classical era and Medieval &amp; Renaissance period to follow.

    <div class="title CanNotDelete">Lost and found: Christopher's performances on folk albums from the 60s and 70s</div>

    <div class="leader">
In the process of expanding his online discography,
Christopher was delighted to rediscover several LPs of albums by folk
groups The Young Tradition and Shirley &amp; Dolly Collins, featuring
Christopher himself on the harpsichord.
    </div> <!-- leader -->

    <p>
In a series of unusual but striking collaborations, these young folk
singers joined forces with players from the Early Music Consort on
period instruments, creating what Dolly Collins felt to be the "natural
orchestra" that her arrangements needed. So far we have unearthed copies
 of "Galleries", by The Young Tradition (1968), along with two albums by
 Shirley &amp; Dolly Collins, "Anthems in Eden" (1969) and "Love, Death
and the Lady" (1970).
</p><p>

Featuring a variety of what were then relatively little-known
instruments including viols, shawm, cornett, sackbut, crumhorns, along
with the harpsichord played by Christopher, these recordings have been
variously referred to as "freak folk" or "folk rock" and represented
something of a departure from Christopher's usual musical style!</p>

all of our cultural expressions are rooted and, as such, transcend any

 had been quick to criticise his first piano trio, Op. 8, the work of a
20-year-old better known as a piano virtuoso. Some 25 years later,
however, upon completion of his second, Op. 87, the by now established
composer could enthuse to his publisher, Simrock: "You have not yet had
such a beautiful trio from me and very likely have not published its
equal in the last ten years!!!"<br>
</p><p>
This new edition is based on Simrock's first edition, taking into
account differing readings in its score and parts, and draws on evidence
 from Brahms' autograph manuscript; Christopher's introduction details
the composition process and revisions, the first performances and
publications, and their reception. The edition also includes a Critical
Commentary and facsimiles of the autograph score, along with a
reproduction of the remaining fragment of a manuscript cello part
apparently rescued from Brahms' waste-paper basket!</p>

    <b>Arne: <i>Eight Harpsichord Sonatas</i> (1974)</b><br>
    This was Christopher Hogwood&#8217;s first record for <i>L&#8217;Oiseau Lyre</i>,
    and this issue marks its first international CD release. Whereas Arne&#8217;s
    career lay primarily in the theatre (his melodic gifts ensured success
    not only in Italianate opera, but in masque and pantomime as well), an
    appointment in 1754 as composer to the Vauxhall Gardens meant that he
    needed to exercise his talents in keyboard concertos as well as song
    writing. Rarely recorded, the <i>Eight Harpsichord Sonatas</i> (all Arne
    ever composed in this genre) are a delight. The Italianate influence of
    Scarlatti, Zipoli and Alberti is present, but there is also something
    of the <i>galant</i> style of German writers. For this recording, the
    original 1756 edition was used and the recordings were made on Kirckman
    (1766) and Blasser (1744) harpsichords. Christopher Hogwood provides a
    new introductory note to this issue as well as notes on the music and
    the instruments used.

    <b>Weber: <i>Lieder</i> (1976)</b><br>
    Weber&#8217;s operas surface reasonably regularly in opera companies&#8217; repertoire around the world, as do his <i>Clarinet Concertos</i> and <i>Clarinet Quintet</i>.
     So it is a joy to welcome to CD for the first time a recording
    specifically selected for reissue by Christopher Hogwood. It was
    recorded with the young Martyn Hill in 1976, and the instrument is an
    original nineteenth-century fortepiano in the Colt Clavier Collection.
    The songs have more than a touch of Schubert about them, but are a
    significant contribution to the Lieder repertoire in their own right.
    The genesis of this project is in itself a story worth telling and
    appears as part of Christopher Hogwood&#8217;s delightful introductory note.

    <b><i>Fitzwilliam Virginal Book</i> (1981)</b><br>
    The <i>Fitzwilliam Virginal Book</i> is one of the most important
    collections of keyboard music of the 16th century. Following the success
    of the double LP released to accompany the Folio Society&#8217;s publication <i>Music at Court</i> (also written by Christopher Hogwood), the Society commissioned further recordings of music connected with royal courts. The <i>Fitzwilliam Virginal Book</i>, along with <i>Musique pour la Chambre du Roy</i>
    (see below), was part of this series, and the collection was
    imaginatively distributed to the Society&#8217;s members, together with
    suitable vintages. To suit the music &#8212; by Farnaby, Byrd, Philips,
    Peerson and Bull, together with anonymous compositions &#8212; the recordings
    were made on different original keyboard instruments: virginal, organ,
    harpsichord and spinet. The recording received critical acclaim and was a
     Gramophone Award nominee in 1983. This marks its first international
    release on CD. The booklet includes the original LP sleeve notes as well
     as a new introduction for the reissue penned by Hogwood himself.

    <b><i>Musique pour la Chambre du Roy</i> (1982)</b><br>
    This seminal recording of French court music returns to the catalogue,
    now with each item and/or movement individually indexed. The offerings
    encompass both suites and cantatas. The music &#8212; written both for and
    around the court life of Versailles (1697&#8211;1747) is sophisticated and
    elegant, taking us from the post-Lully era to the final examples of
    great French baroque chamber music, that of Leclair. The collection is
    notable for the pure, unsullied voice of the late Judith Nelson (a
    long-time collaborator with the Academy of Ancient Music) and viola da
    gamba player Christophe Coin&#8217;s simultaneous narration of the slightly
    grisly  description of an operation to remove a gall-stone! The booklet
    includes the original note, texts and translations of the vocal items,
    and Christopher Hogwood&#8217;s own newly-written introduction for this
    reissue.</p>

    Material from an interview Christopher gave to Philip
    Clark is quoted in an article entitled &#8220;Deconstructing the Genius of
    Bach: How the Baroque master used maths, physics and the power of God to
    create music of stunning complexity&#8221;, recently published in the
    Australian classical music <i>Limelight Magazine</i>.

    The leading British conductor and Bach scholar Christopher Hogwood, who
    in 1973 founded the Academy of Ancient Music with its mission to play
    Baroque music on period instruments, tells me that he&#8217;s puzzled by
    students coming his way who, for instance, play minuets every day of
    their lives without knowing how to dance a minuet. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean
    they don&#8217;t play a charming minuet,&#8221; he says, &#8220;but trying to make sense
    of Bach without knowing what was in his world is a compromise. I
    understand that students who practise their instruments for eight hours a
     day are unlikely to want to go to the library to learn about 18th
    century theology. But there&#8217;s no point in playing a choral prelude
    without knowing the chorale. And if you know the chorale you might as
    well know the words that were sung to the chorale; and then you might as
     well know a little bit about 18th century theology, Lutherism and
    Calvinism, and you&#8217;ll be a little closer to what was in Bach&#8217;s world.&#8221;<br>

    who was to become his close friend, were an instant commercial success,
    with the most popular of them reissued separately not only in England

     and even accompanying figures in the keyboard part &#8212; present in his
    German originals but missing from Shield&#8217;s English edition. Generously
    illustrated with facsimiles from the original publications, which were
    notated on two staves, the new edition, the first in 200 years, uses
    three staves to clarify the voice and keyboard parts, and includes an

    <br clear="all">
    Despite the notable absence of any original &#8216;Dowland keyboard music&#8217;,
    17th-century keyboard players were almost as familiar with the
    composer&#8217;s works as lutenists (who were often one and the same). More
    than 50 English and continental keyboard settings are known to
    survive&#8212;by such respected contemporaries as Bull, Byrd, Farnaby,
    Peerson, Philips, Scheidt and Sweelinck&#8212;but are rarely performed today
    due to mis- givings about the legitimacy of &#8216;arrangements&#8217;. In making
    the case for the reinstatement of these works in the keyboard repertory
    this essay surveys all known manuscript sources (with appendices listing
     modern editions and concordances with the lute originals) and
    illustrates the range of compositional approaches they represent: from
    simple, literal transcriptions to highly virtuosic elaborations, some
    evading and others embracing Dowland&#8217;s striking dissonances. Also
    published here for the first time is a new arrangement by Benjamin Cosyn
     of <i>Lachrymae</i> from a recently discovered manuscript source now part of
    the private collection of William H. and Judith M. Scheide.</p>
