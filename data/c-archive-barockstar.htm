</p><p class="leader">Handel's anniversary year comes to an end with a new documentary &#8212; and an inevitable pun: <i>Barockstar</i>, directed by Ulrich Meyszies and released on DVD by <a href="http://www.arthaus-musik.com/templates/tyCatalogueDetail.php?id=675&amp;topic=catalogue_Documentary">Arthaus Musik</a>,
 'tells the story of Handel's life as he journeyed through baroque 
Europe, leaving Germany for Italy and experiencing Florence, Rome and 
Venice, before arriving in London to begin the career that would bring 
him a worldwide reputation'. It features contributions from Christopher,
 as well as footage from <a href="http://www.handelhouse.org/">Handel House Museum</a>, where Christopher curated this year's keynote exhibition, <a href="http://www.hogwood.org/archive/composers/handel/handel-reveald.html"><i>Handel Reveal'd</i></a>.</p>

Donald
 Burrows &#8212; like Christopher, a Handel biographer &#8212; adds to the 
commentary, along with Howard Arman, Alan Curtis, Andrea Marcon, 
Sandrine Piau and Trevor Pinnock, as the film traces Handel's path from 
Halle, through Italy's flourishing operatic nuclei, to London, where a 
public, and largely imported, Italian opera scene was just getting off 
the ground. Musical illustrations are provided by The English Concert, 
the H&#228;ndelfestspielorchester Halle, the Akademie f&#252;r Alte Musik Berlin 
and Il Complesso Barocco.

No doubt the documentary's title was inspired by the disc's special 
feature on 'Handel and Hendrix': the two musicians were next-door 
neighbours in Brook Street, albeit two centuries apart. Other extras 
include segments on 'Handel and Ruspoli' &#8212; with Prince Ruspoli-Sforza 
and Princess Claudia Ruspoli, descendants of one of Handel's great 
patrons &#8212; and 'The Handel organ in Vallerano'.</p>
