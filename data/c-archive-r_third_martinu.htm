Martin&#367;'s <i>Suite concertante</i> has as chequered a history as any 
work I know. Commissioned in 1938 by Samuel Dushkin &#8211; who premiered 
Stravinsky's Concerto and for whom Martin&#367; had already written his 
then-still-unperformed First Concerto &#8211; Martin&#367; planned a set of five 
Czech dances for violin and orchestra. Completed in early 1939, 
Dushkin's efforts to secure a performance proved vain until 1943, and 
then in a violin-with-piano reduction, the orchestral version (minus its
 central <i>Scherzo-caprice</i> which is lost) only being premiered in 
2000. Dushkin requested a revision but received a new four-movement 
(1943-44) of which only the opening movement has much connection with 
its precursor. Successfully premiered in 1945 and published, the new 
Suite languished unplayed until 1999.

I am at a loss to explain such neglect. Both versions are delightful, 
appealing in idiom, avoiding full-concerto gravitas and brightly scored.
 The first version's Meditation is rather elegiac and may, as Ales 
Brezina suggests in the booklet, reflect Martin&#367;'s faltering liaison 
with his former pupil, V&#237;tezslava Kapr&#225;lov&#225;. Matou&#353;ek, who premiered the
 first version and revived the second (recording it with Hogwood for 
Supraphon), plays both with great understanding and finesse: the music 
needs lightness of touch and receives it here. Both versions of the 
Suite run out somewhat longer than Dushkin's projected timings but the 
tempi feel right.
</p><p>
In the <i>Rhapsody-Concerto</i> Matou&#353;ek shows himself as adept a 
viola-player as he is violinist, sweeter-toned than Telecky and a match 
for Imai and Bukac. Hogwood and the Czech Philharmonic again provide 
immaculate accompaniments, Hyperion's sound in Prague's Rudolfinum 
preferable to BIS's in Malm&#246;. (The rivals are all mixed-composer discs.)
 This third volume in Hyperion's invaluable series is as desirable as 
its predecessors: highly recommended.
