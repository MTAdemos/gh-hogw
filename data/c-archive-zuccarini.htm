The problems of ornamenting a slow movement were as apparent in the 18th
 century as they are to players today: even Charles Burney admitted that
 it was an area &#8220;in which performers of great powers of execution often 
fail&#8221;. Carlo Zuccari comes to the rescue with a dozen sample adagios 
printed with both the simple line and a decorated alternative. There are
 no written rules in his collection &#8212; simply teaching by the direct 
method, and applicable to all melodic instruments (violin, flute, oboe, 
cello etc).</p>
