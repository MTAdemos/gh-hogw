 was released in November 2009 and has since received excellent reviews.
 "The two musicians [Silver and Garburg] play this vivacious and 
sparkling music in an extremely fresh and lively manner, giving an 
outstandingly textured and minutely coordinated performance. They are 
attentively and precisely accompanied by the Bayerische 
Kammerphilharmonie under the direction of the versatile grand master 
Christopher Hogwood." (Michael Wersin, translated from <a href="http://www.rondomagazin.de/kritiken.php?kritiken_id=6880"><i>Rondo-Magazin</i></a>).

"The E major work has an engaging and lively finale, needing just the 
wit and the sense of not taking things to seriously which Sivan Silver 
and Gil Garburg bring to it.....and they play [the works] with 
enthusiasm but also with real appreciation of the young composer's 
musical intelligence. Obviously there are problems of balance, but these
 are skillfully solved, with the two pianos cleanly differentiated and 
set against an orchestra not too large in size and expertly controlled 
by Christopher Hogwood. The sound is clear and bright, the sense of 
enjoyment, not excluding an element of showing off in the music, 
dominating the proceedings. Presumably it was some lack of demand that 
prevented the concertos being published until long after Mendelssohn's 
death, in the 1960's, and of course they make for expensive programming,
 but they are well worth hearing." (John Warrack, <a href="http://recordreview.co.uk/index.php"><i>International Record Review</i></a>).</p>
