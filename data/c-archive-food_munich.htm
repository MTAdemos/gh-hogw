A week spent recording Mendelssohn in Munich was a 
chance to observe the severe disproportion between the large number of 
beer gardens or food outlets dealing in Bavarian cuisine and the much 
rarer alternatives. After a deal of asking and hunting, two very 
recommendable Italian restaurants came to light, both close to the 
Prinzregent Theater, one completely free of Muzak, the other only 
lightly affected.

In spite of the worryingly surgical name (but it also describes a type 
of sea-horse), the atmosphere is quiet and attentive and the food 
combinations adventurous without being wild. Fine sea food (lobster NOT 
overpriced for once) and really fresh salads, fresh pasta and sweets 
which were of a reasonable size and not disastrous for spreading 
waist-lines. Wine lists well selected and without appalling mark-ups; 
both Roero and Morellino were to be found, for me a test of a sensible 
cellar. Absolutely no background music, nor any invasive cooking. Lunch 
runs until 4 in the afternoon and dinner until 1 in the morning, so 
post-concert eating is unrushed. Web-site also in English; highly 
recommended.

If you can&#8217;t find a place in Hippocampus (they advise booking although 
we got a fine table without any prior warning), close by is

I was introduced to this restaurant by the flute-player Andras Adorj&#225;n, 
and their lunches are very recommendable; house wine is fine, but a 
larger list exists, and the fact that they serve excellent pizzas 
doesn&#8217;t seem to have compromised the remainder of the menu. Many 
vegetarian options and a good menu of the day to speed things up. The 
Muzak only struck up when we were the last people remaining in the 
dining room! Website also (like so much of Germany) bi-lingual.</p>
