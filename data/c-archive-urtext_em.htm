This article forms part of the 40th Anniversary Issue of <i>Early Music</i> and joins ranks with articles by 33 other respected figures in the
early music world. 

</p><p>
Christopher's contribution advocates the use of the 'process' edition, as opposed to Urtext or <i>Fassung letzer Hand</i>
 editions, as a way of allowing the performer to compare progressive 
versions of a work. This is particularly important in cases such as 
Mendelssohn's symphonies where, as Christopher has found in editing 
them, there is sometimes no definitive or truly final version.
