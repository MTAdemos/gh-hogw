March 2005 produced rather fewer encounters with good after-concert food
 (there being no trips to Italy) but nevertheless some pleasant 
surprises.
</p><p>
In Switzerland, working with KOB and recording in Lucerne, there were two favourite spots:
</p><p>
Opus, a <i>Vinotek</i> close to the opera house and beside the lake, has
 two eating areas, a cosy cellarage area where you eat at small tables 
surrounded by racked wines, all displaying their credentials and prices 
on labels to tempt the diner, or a more canteen-like area at the other 
end of the establishment (choose the former if you are allowed). There 
is also a small delicatessen shop with gadgets for sale (a cheese grater
 which impales the parmesan and looks both ingenious and attractive in 
cherry-wood, though we found from past experience that if the cheese is 
at all aged, it will also fall off in large lumps). The food menu is 
restrained and some items are only available at &#8216;normal&#8217; dining hours 
(i.e. not after concerts) but the range of wines is enormous and the 
published trade list many times longer than the menu. The front-of-house
 bar does tapas snacks and wines by the glass &#8212; a place to be seen in 
Lucerne.

Slightly further away, a walk across the &#8216;Dance of Death&#8217; bridge and 
along the lake brings you to the Ristorante Padrino (part of the very 
Grand-Hotel National, again by the lake). Italian cooking, Indian 
service (both excellent) and a <i>patron</i> who really recommends with 
vigour. Very fresh pasta, excellent fish, no music, good sweets and 
apparently no need to book (though this was not high season).

Because of the popular annual Jewellery and Watch Fair in Basel, I was 
not accommodated in the central Hotel Basel as usual, but forty minutes 
drive away in the German spa town of Badenweiler. The Hotel R&#246;merbad was
 a step back in time, but with the assets of an old-style grand 
restaurant (mostly empty) and a lunching terrace looking onto magnolia 
trees, a ruined castle and the distant Black Forest. Excellent 
old-school waiting (including a ma&#238;tre-d&#8217; who ventured that he liked my 
recording of the Bach French Suites!) and again, absolutely no 
background music. The big spa complex a short stroll away in the village
 offers many different shapes, sizes and temperatures of baths 
(including a whirlpool that drags you round in a circle &#8212; zero effort) 
and every brand of massage and health treatment, with ultimate German 
efficiency. The hotel, incidentally, supports a music festival; pictures
 of the Emerson Quartet, Henze, George Benjamin and Birtwistle on the 
walls as you walk to your room.

It would be unfair not to mention some English addresses here, so two recent venues, one a favourite and one a discovery:
</p><p>
Northwards from Cambridge (towards Ely and turn left) is the village of 
Sutton, and through Sutton and a small (slightly signed) right turn is 
Sutton Gault (not on many AA maps). The Anchor is a pub-restaurant 
beside the River Ouse (though, as with many Fenland waterways, the 
embankments are raised so high that your view through the windows is of 
grass), with gas mantle lighting still functioning. Good, shortish 
gastro-menu, unusual wines by the glass and friendly service which goes 
on delivering lunch on Sunday well into the afternoon (but the rooms are
 small, so better book). Again, without the hazard of wallpaper music, 
but some good art on the walls (we spotted Tom Philips and Paul Nash). 
Good walking amongst sheep and lambs by the river afterwards.

<img class="imgleft" src="upload/rest-thai271.jpg">The
 new discovery was a Vietnamese restaurant in East London, to which we 
were led by Caz Hildebrand, who has designed almost every cookbook you 
have on your shelves (Moro, Nigella Lawson, Jamie Oliver etc.). Huong 
Viet is in a utilitarian building that describes itself outside as a 
Vietnamese Community and Education Centre, but inside is a thriving and 
busy restaurant, with scarcely a Vietnamese diner in sight. A 
comprehensible menu, wine list (or BYO) and the usual temptation to 
order more than you need. Spicy squid, spring rolls with prawn, tilapia 
fish soup spiced with (possibly?) cinnamon, clay-pot items and sizzling 
plates. The set menu for &#163;15 looked like a bargain. Just don&#8217;t go for 
the decor.
