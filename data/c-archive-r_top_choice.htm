Jeremy Summerly&#8217;s top recommendation for a recording of Purcell&#8217;s <i>Dido and Aeneas</i> in <i>Building a Library</i> (BBC Radio 3, 20 March 2009) is
Christopher&#8217;s &#8220;carefully fashioned, modern classic on Decca&#8221; (L&#8217;Oiseau-Lyre 436 992-2OHO).

&#8220;The choral singing is of the highest standard all the way through. The 
suave Academy of Ancient music is tidy and refined under the direction 
of Christopher Hogwood.
</p><p class="quote">
&#8220;The singers and players of the Academy of Ancient Music respond 
willingly to Christopher Hogwood&#8217;s sensitive direction. John Mark 
Ainsley is a romantic, valiant and heroic Aeneas, Emma Kirkby&#8217;s Belinda 
is exquisite, and Catherine Bott is a riveting Dido.

&#8220;During my initial, blind listening, I made copious notes on each track 
of each recording, mainly so that I wouldn&#8217;t change my mind once I had 
revealed to myself who I&#8217;d been listening to. While revelling in 
Christopher Hogwood&#8217;s version, or recording V as I knew it then, I 
simply resorted to larger and larger ticks when Dido started to sing.&#8221;
