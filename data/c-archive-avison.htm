In
 April 2005 Christopher accepted an invitation to become an Honorary
Member of The Charles Avison Society. The Charles Avison Society aims to
 &#8216;revive the music, reputation and memory of Newcastle&#8217;s baroque
composer&#8217;.

</p><p>

Charles Avison, baptised on 16 February 1709, was an important figure in
 composition in the eighteenth century, though his achievements are
often overlooked. Born in Newcastle and living away from the hotspot
that was London at this time, Avison did not enjoy the fame that was
enjoyed by William Boyce and Thomas Arne, who were busy making their
mark in London. However, Avison&#8217;s impact on the musical life of the
eighteenth century must not be understated; he is considered to be the
most important English concerto composer of the eighteenth century.

</p><p>
Richard Avison, Charles&#8217; father, was a musician and presumably used his
contacts to further his son&#8217;s career. Certainly, it is documented that
Avison had help from an MP and wealthy patron of the arts, Ralph
Jenison, which must have enabled Avison to continue his musical studies
more comfortably. Despite unsupported claims that Avison studied in
Italy, William Hayes and Charles Burney wrote that Avison studied with
Geminiani when he was in England.

</p><p>
The earliest documentation of his musical career is an announcement of a
 benefit concert on 20 March, 1734, in London at Hickford&#8217;s Room. In
June 1736, Avison became organist of St John&#8217;s Church in Newcastle
having, apparently, turned down various jobs in London, Dublin, York and
 Edinburgh. In the October of the same year, Avison accepted another
position at St Nicholas in Newcastle, and indeed he kept that position
until his death in 1770.

</p><p>

<img class="imgright" src="upload/av-ensemble.jpg">In
 1735, he organised the Newcastle Subscription Concerts which became one
 of the most successful concert series outside the capital. Avison&#8217;s
sons Edward and Charles continued these concerts after his death and
they have been revived in recent years by The Charles Avison Society.

</p><p>
In 1752 Avison published &#8216;An Essay on Musical Expression&#8217; which is
considered to be the first treatise of musical criticism in English.

</p><p>
As a composer Avison is best known for his concerti for strings which
total over 80. Other works include chamber and sacred music. In his
orchestra, Avison had some notable performers of the time: William
Herschel &#8212; celebrated astronomer, Ralph Beilby &#8212; engraver, and William
Shield &#8212; a pupil of Avison, who later became Master of the King&#8217;s Music.
