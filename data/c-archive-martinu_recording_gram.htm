"This CD marks the start of a project with the Kammerorchester Basel 
(KOB) to develop certain programming traits which were typical of the 
Basler Kammerorchester under the direction of Paul Sacher. The archives 
of the Sacher Stiftung in Basel contain many treasures of contemporary 
music commissioned by Sacher, and first performed by him. In addition 
the documentation of more than 50 years of concert giving, both with the
 Basler Kammerorchester and the Collegium Musicum Z&#252;rich demonstrates 
his masterly sense of the possibilities of combining old and new music 
to best effect. This juxtaposition we feel is still a vital ingredient 
of our concert planning, while many of the twentieth century works 
dedicated to the orchestra and Sacher are best presented in the contexts
 for which he originally designed them. The programme of this CD 
replicates a concert given on 21 January 1947 to celebrate twenty years 
of the Basler Kammerorchester with three works specially commissioned 
from leading composers for the occasion. The sleeve notes included are 
also taken from the annotations supplied by the original composers for 
the occasion."</p>
