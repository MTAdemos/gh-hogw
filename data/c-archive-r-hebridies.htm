 following review of Christopher&#8217;s edition of Mendelssohn&#8217;s The Hebrides
 overture appeared in Nineteenth-Century Music Review, volume 3, issue

</p><p>
<i>Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, Die Hebriden. Konzert-Ouvert&#252;re (The 
Hebrides. Concert Overture) op. 26, edited by Christopher Hogwood 
(Kassel: B&#228;renreiter, 2004). xxxi + 103pp. &#163;28.50.</i>
</p><p>
Of all Mendelssohn&#8217;s orchestral pieces, the Hebrides overture poses the 
greatest problems for the editor. While the opening theme &#8212; famously 
presented in a short score in a letter to his family of 7 August 1829 &#8212; 
may seem to epitomize the composer&#8217;s supposedly effortless creativity, 
the work as a whole underwent a stringent and protracted process of 
revision. The full score was completed in December 1830, yet the 
overture was to go through at least five further guises prior to its 
publication in 1835. Since both the surviving autographs (dated 16 
December 1830 and 20 June 1832) served as working scores for later 
revisions, neither presents one of the six versions of the work in a 
pure form; moreover, Mendelssohn&#8217;s mania for last-minute revisions was 
such that he introduced further changes at proof stage, with the result 
that the 1835 printed orchestral parts and full score diverge 
significantly.
</p><p>
It is only since 2002, when the 1832 autograph became accessible again 
to scholars through its purchase by the Bodleian Library, that a more 
complete picture of the work&#8217;s gestation has begun to emerge. In the 
light of this, John Michael Cooper has presented a painstaking and 
comprehensive reappraisal of the sources; equally indispensable is 
Christopher Hogwood&#8217;s new edition, which has clearly benefited greatly 
from Cooper&#8217;s findings. While the new availability of the 1832 autograph
 clarifies the composition history of the overture, it does not make the
 editor&#8217;s task any more straightforward. One of the strengths of 
Hogwood&#8217;s edition is that it conveys, graphically and transparently, the
 illusory nature of any attempt to present a definitive version of the 
Hebrides overture. Rather than following the lead of Julius Rietz, whose
 1874 text constructs an ideal version of the work, Hogwood&#8217;s edition 
enables the study and performance of four distinct versions. He presents
 two scores of the overture, each of which gives two variants (labelling
 these &#8216;Rome versions&#8217;, pp. 1&#8211;44, and &#8216;London versions&#8217;, pp.45&#8211;95).
</p><p>
Hogwood&#8217;s labelling, while convenient, inevitably oversimplifies the 
relationship between his texts and the sources (Cooper&#8217;s more detailed 
survey of the sources identifies Rome, Rome-Paris, London, 
London-Berlin, Berlin-Leipzig, and Leipzig versions of the overture). In
 addition, it should be stressed that the work was never performed in 
either of the so-called Rome versions, while the likely text of the 
London performances of May and June 1832 can only be reconstructed 
hypothetically. But although textual questions remain, Hogwood&#8217;s 
critical commentary is the first to identify all the variants, while his
 texts enable non-specialists to engage with the complex compositional 
history of the work. As a result, we can better understand how the 
work&#8217;s unique stylistic world evolved, and the poetic and programmatic 
content that Mendelssohn intended it to convey.
</p><p>
The provisional nature of the first version was acknowledged by 
Mendelssohn, who identified the final section of the exposition as 
irrelevant bluster and felt the artifice of other passages to detract 
from the atmosphere he sought to evoke (p.v). These concerns motivated 
the most extensive revisions: the rewriting of the end of the exposition
 (whose first version has more in common with a celebratory piece of 
occasional music than with the picturesque opening), and the removal of 
imitative treatments of the opening theme in the transition to the 
second subject. Other revisions, too, seem motivated by the poetic 
content. The sharpening of the rhythms at the climax of the development,
 as well as the addition of fanfare-like material elsewhere, confirms 
the picture suggested by the shifting titles of the overture (from Die 
Hebriden or the Ouvert&#252;re zu der einsamen Insel in the earliest versions
 to Fingals H&#246;hle in the 1835 full score): Mendelssohn&#8217;s original 
intention to create a musical seascape increasingly acquired Ossianic 
resonances.
</p><p>
In addition to discussing the revision process, Hogwood&#8217;s introduction 
very usefully presents a programme note by George Grove, written for a 
Crystal Palace concert in October 1871 in which two versions of the 
overture were given side by side (pp.viii&#8211;x). Grove&#8217;s comparison comes 
down heavily in favour of the later version; a curiosity of Hogwood&#8217;s 
edition is that it seemingly grants equal validity to his Rome and 
London versions, aiming &#8216;to provide performers with all musically 
pertinent readings to this complex composition&#8217; (p. 96). While Hogwood&#8217;s
 even-handedness has resulted in a fine resource for scholars and 
students, it seems unlikely that many orchestras will seek to recreate 
Grove&#8217;s 1871 concert. Indeed &#8212; given the availability of orchestral 
parts of the new edition &#8212; it is worth exploring whether orchestras 
seeking to perform the work in its later form will benefit from 
investing in them. In short, what advantages does Hogwood&#8217;s second 
London version have over existing editions?
</p><p>
Performers have hitherto relied on materials derived from Rietz&#8217;s text 
for the Breitkopf &amp; H&#228;rtel complete edition, a source that Hogwood, 
like most Mendelssohn scholars, damns as uncritical and corrupt (p. 
iii). But while Rietz&#8217;s editorial procedures hardly meet the standards 
of modern scholarship, it is important not to exaggerate the extent of 
his interventions. Rietz&#8217;s edition is problematic not primarily on 
account of textual flaws but because his additions and alterations were 
made tacitly, His emendations to The Hebrides are in fact sparse and 
trivial in nature: the addition of expressive markings (e,g., 
&#8216;tranquillo assai&#8217; at the return of the second subject (bar 201)); the 
occasional replacement of terraced dynamics with more gradual contrasts 
(e.g., bars 146&#8211;147); and, more straightforwardly, the standardization 
of expressive marks. Rietz&#8217;s decision to preserve the version of bars 7 
and 8 found in both the autographs, rather than to incorporate 
Mendelssohn&#8217;s last-minute reversion to the melodic line of his sketch of
 August 1829, is typical of his approach: musical preferences take 
precedence over philological principles. Hogwood&#8217;s &#8216;London&#8217; version, in 
contrast, sticks with the published 1835 version of these bars, though 
it retains the familiar line as an ossia. In spite of their diverging 
editorial criteria, there are few other substantive differences between 
this version and Rietz&#8217;s text. Indeed, there are several places in 
Hogwood&#8217;s edition where Rietz&#8217;s approach to dynamics might usefully have
 been adopted (viola players will have to pencil in a diminuendo in bar 
20, for example, and there are other places where editorial dynamics are
 needed).
</p><p>
Mendelssohn scholarship has been considerably enriched by this volume 
and its companions (at the time of writing, the publication of the final
 of the seven volumes in Hogwood&#8217;s series of Mendelssohn&#8217;s concert 
overtures, Meeresstille und gl&#252;ckliche Fahrt, is imminent). It is to be 
hoped that an enterprising record company encourages Hogwood to record 
all the early versions that he has unearthed, and that his editions will
 encourage orchestras and listeners to reappraise these works.
