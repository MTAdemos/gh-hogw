Volume one of the complete keyboard works of Hardenack Otto Conrad Zinck was reviewed in <i>Clavichord International</i>, 15. no. 1 (May 2011), and the remaining two
volumes are now available.

</p><p>
Volume 2 contains a further six sonatas, the first four of which appeared in print between 1791 and 1793 in the four volumes of <i>Compositioner for Sangen og Claveret</i>. In general, they exhibit less of the <i>Empfindsamkeit</i>
 of the sonatas in the first volume (although the slow movement of 
Sonata 8 is a highly passionate work recalling Zinck's teacher, C.P.E. 
Bach) and a greater assimilation of Haydnesque figures. There are still 
plenty of notable moments, including the first movement of Sonata 7, 
which is built entirely on dotted or triplet figures, and the central 
section of that Sonata's final rondo-like movement, in which a 
syncopated figure in octaves covers some 60 bars. Sonata 8, in G minor, 
offers far greater originality verging on the eccentric in its 
modulations, figurations, and textural and tempo changes in the first 
movement; indeed, there is a passage of arpeggiated triads in 
sixteenth-note triplets that could be the eighteenth-century counterpart
 to the well-known closing passage of Rossi's Toccata 7! The closing 
Presto also makes forays into extraneous keys, its mainly two-voiced 
texture being interrupted by full chords in the left hand. The first 
movement of Sonata 9 is a <i>moto perpetuo</i> with little respite, 
while the slow movement carries the comment that if the composer had had
 a good mood and more time, he would have composed further and better 
variations to go with the one printed. The closing Rondo is short - its 
eighth-note movement is not as taxing as other pieces in this 
collection. The first movement of Sonata 10 is close to Ko&#382;eluch, and 
alternates allegro figuration with a <i>cantabile</i>, Italianate second
 subject. Its slow movement also offers contrasts, the central section 
consisting of sixteenth-note figuration over quarter notes. The closing 
Poco a poco presto in 3/8 offers sufficient rhythmic and articulation 
challenges, and requires a top G.
</p><p>
The remaining two sonatas are taken from a manuscript collection 
compiled by Zinck's brother, Bendix, and are in general considerably 
less demanding. The first one opens with an andante, followed by a short
 <i>Romanze</i> marked <i>lanto</i>, and closes with an <i>Andantino con [8] variazioni</i> with increasingly lively figuration through to No. 5 and closing with a <i>Presto al'lnglese</i>.
 The opening movement of the second sonata from this MS is built almost 
entirely on Alberti bass figuration below a cantabile line; one wonders 
what his teacher would have said! There follows a <i>Grazioso</i> in similar style, and the sonata closes with a Rondo that is full of tuneful charm, although it is trickier than it appears.

</p><p>
Volume 3 includes two sets of variations and some twelve short, 
miscellaneous pieces, including an untitled piece marked as a "stop-gap"
 taken from <i>Compositioner</i> that is in the style of a polonaise. 
From the manuscript compiled by his brother there are three minuets, a 
polonaise, an Adagio, an Allegretto, and a Rondo. There are also three <i>Solfeggii</i>
 (one being in two versions); one is a simple binary-form piece mainly 
in quarter notes, the other two have brilliant right-hand passagework. 
The other piece is a setting of the song "<i>Das Traumschiff</i>," its flowing melodic line over sixteenth notes approaching Schubert, or even the <i>Lieder ohne Worte</i>
 of Mendelssohn. The reproduction of the melody and text written onto a 
ship's sails is fascinating. Most of these pieces are carefully 
fingered. The sets of variations comprise seven on the popular song "<i>Lison dormait</i>," taken from the <i>Compositioner</i>
 collection and specifically directed by the composer towards the 
younger player. These increase in brilliance, but only the crossed hands
 passages in No. 5 pose any real problem. The  expansive set of 
twenty-four variations on the "<i>Rundgesang der Kinder in Ludwigslust</i>"
 was published separately in 1787, and its origins are described in the 
Introduction. Suffice it to say that its striking technical demands in 
the later variations, including an extensive cadenza, will exercise even
 professional players.

This new edition faithfully carries across the fingering, phrasing and 
highly detailed articulation markings that make these pieces so suitable
 for the clavichord. Volume 2 is ring-bound with a wrap-around cover, 
while Volume 3, being shorter, is stapled (the pages remain open without
 any problems). Christopher Hogwood deserves our thanks for disinterring
 these pieces, in particular the sonatas, and especially the quirkily 
original No. 8 in Volume 2, from the mausoleum of the lesser-known 
composers. It is for us to bring them to life beneath our fingers and 
introduce them to a fresh audience.
