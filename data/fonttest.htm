<h1>Example of downloading fonts from Google: this heading is in Marcellus</h1>

<h2 class=eagle>This is in Eagle font</h2>
<p class=eagle>
This page is intended to illustrated the one problem with downloading fonts 
from Google, which is that there is a brief delay before the font downloads, so 
a page may appear in another font first and then re-display in the downloaded 
font. 
How far this is a problem depends on connection speeds: I sometimes 
notice this on my slow broadband connection in Wales, but it is usually less of 
a problem in Cambridge.
</div>

<h2 class=tenor>This is in tenor font</h2>
<p class=tenor>
The way style definitions work you supply a list of fonts in the style 
definition, and the browser uses the first one on the list that it can find. If 
the instruction to download from Google is there, then it displays using the 
first font on the list that it can find, but also starts downloading.
If it happens that the font I've specified as a google font is already on your 
machine, then it would display without downloading. For the purposes of this 
test, I have used three fonts which you are unlikely to have but there is a 
good range to explore at:

<A href="http://www.google.com/fonts" 
target="new">www.google.com/fonts</a>

</p>

<p class=tenor>
If you don't like the sense of a page re-displaying, another way to use Google 
fonts is as a fallback. Usually for a web site it makes sense to specify fonts 
that are common, so they are very likely to be on people's computers. Google 
fonts makes it possible to specify a font that is reasonably likely to be on 
most people's machines,  with a credible alternative from Google to download if 
the desired font is not available.
