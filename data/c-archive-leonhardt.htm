Gustav Leonhardt, the Dutch harpsichordist, conductor 
and pioneer of the early music movement, died on Monday at the age of 
83.  He was one of the most significant figures in the field of 
historically informed performance practice.  As a keyboardist and 
conductor he made some of the most defining recordings of the 20th 
century. His students, including Christopher who studied the keyboard 
with him during the late 1960s, are amongst today's leading figures in 
the field of early music.  You can hear Christopher reflecting on the 
life and work of Gustav Leonhardt on Radio 3's In Tune with Sean 
Rafferty by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/showcase/clips/p00nb1d0/in/justadded/justadded">clicking here.</a>
