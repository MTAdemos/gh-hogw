 with the orchestral tuttis and including a new (optional) viola part, 
this new version will be suitable for smaller chamber ensembles with a 
continuo section of cello, double-bass and keyboard. The textures are 
very similar to those of Vivaldi's Op. 3 concertos and the three violin 
parts require a similar brilliance of technique.
</p><p>
The precedents for this arrangement of Bach's concerto for three 
harpsichords and strings BWV 1064 can be found in earlier baroque 
concertos for multiple violins without ripieno orchestra, such as 
Vivaldi's first published concertos, Op. 3 (<i>L'Estro Armonico</i>), 
and similar works by Leonardo Leo, Van Wassenaer and Telemann for either
 three or four solo violins.  Laying no claim to reconstruction 
according to historical evidence (which in any case is insufficient 
since many of the surviving sources are post-1800), the arrangement has 
been made for practical musical purposes for inclusion alongside other 
repertoire for three violin soloists without ripieno players, 
Pachelbel's Canon and Gigue being just one example of this popular 
scoring.  In its first version this arrangement was prepared for 
performance and recording by members of the Academy of Ancient Music, 
and many of the subsequent revisions resulted from suggestions made by 
the performers, to whom much of the credit should be given.</p>

<img src="upload/bachtripleinside.jpg" alt="bachtripleinside.jpg" class="imgright" height="380" width="275">No
 autograph of Bach's original has survived and the work is now preserved
 in some nine manuscript copies (including a score by his pupil J.A. 
Agricola); in five of these the piece is in C major, in the other four 
in D major.  Both this and the other Concerto for three harpsichords 
(BWV 1063) have long been suspected of being based on earlier Italian 
pieces; Arnold Schering suggested Vivaldi or Torelli on the grounds that
 the formal design of the first movement was untypical of Bach, and he 
was also the first to point out the prevalence of violinistic figuration
 in the keyboard parts.  The evidence of similar transcriptions by Bach 
where direct comparison with the original is possible, such as his 
version of the B minor concerto from <i>L'Estro Armonico</i> for four 
violins, shows that they would normally be transposed down a tone to 
better fit the range of the harpsichord, and a new accompaniment for the
 ripieno strings devised - in some cases the involvement of junior Bach 
family members is suspected; D major, therefore, is most likely to have 
been the key of the original and is certainly more suited to the violin.
