<p>A former pupil of Corelli, Geminiani (1687-1762)
 had already published two sets of arrangements of his mentor's works in
 1726 (Concertos after Corelli Op. 5, nos 1-6) and 1729 (Nos 7-12). 
Although it was to Geminiani's financial advantage to promote his 
connection with the much-admired master, it was also apparently an act 
of reverence, expanding interest in Corelli's music, and bringing to the
 professional concert platform works that had previously been restricted
 to chamber (often amateur) settings. The original sonatas are 
transformed into concertos by the addition of ripieno violins and an 
(occasionally) concertino viola, while the continuo part is adapted to 
the new context from Corelli's organo part. While some contemporary 
critics still preferred the "light original dress" of the originals, 
others &#8212; including the public &#8212; approved Geminiani's removing "some of 
the ancient Stiffness of Style" and giving the music "a more easy, free 
and flowing air."

<p>
The 3 Concertos from "Select Harmony" followed the next year, as part of
 a series that included works by Vivaldi, Albinoni and "other Eminent 
Italian Authors". Hawkins, having heard the first of these concertos in 
concert, thought the second movement fugue "perhaps one of the finest 
compositions of the kind ever heard" (although he misremembered the mode
 and metre of the movement).

</p><p>
Thought to be among Geminiani's last publications, the 2 Unison 
Concertos are quite different to his other, mostly seven-part concertos,
 being this time only in two parts, both the first and second violins 
directed to perform from the upper, treble staff, and everyone else from
 the lower, bass staff. Whether Geminiani was satirising or supporting 
the "modern" galant idiom, often criticised for its lack of counterpoint
 and dependence on attractive melodic lines, is hard to determine; he 
most likely intended the concertos to demonstrate principals of 
composition outlined in his <i>Guida Armonica</i> (<i>c</i>1752), particularly the level of harmonic invention he believed necessary in music of all styles.

The concertos are further discussed in Christopher's Introduction and 
Critical Commentary to the edition, and illustrated with facsimiles from
 the original editions. Also included are a table of ornaments and an 
Appendix by Richard Maunder on the present state of research into 
performance numbers for concertos such as these. A practical edition, 
including parts, will follow shortly. Samples of the score may be viewed
 <a href="upload/gce002.pdf">here</a>.

</p><p>
Further volumes of Geminiani are expected in the coming months, 
including the six concertos of Op. 7 (edited by Richard Maunder) and the
 treatises <i>The Art of Accompaniment</i> (Peter Williams), <i>The Rules for Playing in a True Taste</i> Op. 8, 
<i>A Treatise of Good Taste in the Art of Musick</i> and <i>The Art of Playing on the Violin</i> Op. 9 (Peter Walls).</p>
