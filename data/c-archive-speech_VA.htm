Christopher spoke at Christ Church, Spitalfields last 
Monday in a press launch in anticipation of the V&amp;A&#8217;s exhibition, 
Baroque 1620 &#8211; 1800: Style in the Age of Magnificence, which will take 
place from April to July 2009.

 exhibition coincides with the 250th anniversary of Handel's death and 
the 350th anniversary of Purcell's birth. The V&amp;A is one of a host 
of partner organisations participating in Baroque 09, a series of 
cultural events celebrating the achievements of the baroque era.

Ben Hoyle writing in The Times on 22nd October commented on the stir that Christopher&#8217;s speech created: 
</p><p style="padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px;">
&#8220;The hacks were serenaded by the soprano Rosemary Joshua, then harangued
 by the conductor Christopher Hogwood, who took exception to a piece in 
The Spectator that claimed that &#8220;the more you know (about art) the less 
you feel&#8221;. &#8220;Anyone who agrees with that,&#8221; he glowered, &#8220;please come and 
see me afterwards.&#8221; No one dared.&#8221;</p>
