Mendelssohn
 made his first visit to Scotland in 1829, following which he wrote some
 of his most successful works, inspired by the Scottish landscape. The 
'Scottish' Symphony was however not completed until 1842, after a 
complicated gestation process of over 12 years. 
</p><p>
The work was enthusiastically received at its premiere in Leipzig in 
March that year, and a second performance took place there two weeks 
later. In the short period between the two concerts, Mendelssohn fully 
revised the symphony, and this new version was the basis for the 
performance which he conducted in June 1842 in London. In 1843 
Mendelssohn then authorised the work&#8217;s publication.
</p><p>
The 'Scottish', which is often regarded as Mendelssohn&#8217;s greatest 
contribution to the symphonic form, survives in several sources and 
Christopher&#8217;s critical new edition makes use of all of these. The 
preface contains valuable information and describes Mendelssohn&#8217;s 12 
year compositional process from the first impressions in his youth to a 
mature large-scale symphony. 
</p><p>
The critical edition offers not only the well-known published version 
authorised by the composer in 1843, but also the London version of 1842.
 Both versions are presented in score and in performance material. 
Movements 1 and 4 are presented twice, in the 1842 and the 1843 version,
 whereas the small number of changes representing the 1842 London 
version are rendered in movements 2 and 3 as ossia staves in both score 
and parts.  The edition includes facsimile pages and an informative 
introduction by Christopher.</p>
