Feedback                
=======
There is now an "OKToPublish" box under each feedback entry. These all 
appear in the /tmp version, but only the ones with "OJToPublish" ticked 
appear in the live site.


Controls
=======
I've removed the control box and set the hover colour to the dark red and 
the column width to 90ex


Links on instrument pages (e.g. Boalch)
=======================================
These now get an underline when you hover the mouse over them (as other links 
do)

Geminiani
========
Many apologies for the mistakes in converting this -- it should be fine now


Discography
===========

Searching: "K136", "K.136" "K 136" and "K. 136" search differently
