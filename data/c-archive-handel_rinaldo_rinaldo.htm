With Christopher&#8217;s recording of <i>Rinaldo</i> winning its second award 
in under six months, it&#8217;s time to take a look at the story which has 
helped to make this opera so popular across the years.
</p><p>
<b><i>The Rinaldo story by Suzanne Aspden</i></b>
</p><p>
In hindsight, the 1711 premiere of Handel&#8217;s first opera written for 
London, and directed by the composer himself, seems an auspicious 
occasion. The cynical observations of Joseph Addison in the <i>Spectator</i>
 probably give us a more accurate view of contemporaries&#8217; response, 
however. In order to create an agreeable entertainment for the winter 
months, Addison says, &#8216;the opera house&#8217;s production of <i>Rinaldo</i> is
 filled with thunder and lightning, illuminations and fire-works; which 
the audience may look upon without catching cold, and indeed without 
much danger of being burnt; for there are several engines filled with 
water, and ready to play at a minute&#8217;s warning&#8217; (<i>Spectator</i>, 6 March 1711).
</p><p>
Addison is also dismissive of the source from which <i>Rinaldo</i> was drawn, Tasso&#8217;s <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i>
 (1581), finding that one verse in Virgil is worth all the clinquant or 
tinsel of Tasso. Here contemporaries would not have supported him: 
Tasso&#8217;s story of the first crusade was perhaps the most important epic 
of the sixteenth century, rivalled only by Ariosto&#8217;s <i>Orlando Furioso</i>.
 Its initial popularity as inspiration for madrigal verse continued 
throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when it was one of 
the most important source texts for opera, prompting nearly 100 operas 
and ballets. The episode featuring the Saracen sorceress Armida&#8217;s love 
for the Christian hero Rinaldo, her bewitchment of him, his rejection of
 her and her ensuing fury, pursuit, and eventual reconciliation with him
 was particularly attractive to opera librettists, and most operas based
 on this story were named for the vibrant, vengeful enchantress.
</p><p>
Monteverdi seems to have started the process of dramatising the story 
with a cantata in 1626 (it is now lost). Italian operas were written on 
the subject in 1638, 1639 and 1641, and Lully set Quinault&#8217;s <i>Armide</i>
 in 1686. Quinault&#8217;s libretto, which only concerned the first half of 
Tasso&#8217;s story, up to Rinaldo&#8217;s flight from Armida, was then used as the 
basis for a number of mid-eighteenth-century settings by C. H. Graun 
(1751), Traetta (1761), Astarita (1773), and Gluck (1777). Rossini&#8217;s 
1817 setting also ends with the destruction of Armida&#8217;s palace. In other
 versions, the librettists chose to continue to later encounters between
 Rinaldo and Armida on the battlefield, sometimes allowing the pair to 
reconcile, sometimes not. In Dvorak&#8217;s 1904 opera, a disguised Armida is 
killed by Rinaldo in battle; reconciliation comes only as she dies, with
 her baptism. In this ending we notice an echo of the story of Tancredi 
and Clorinda. Similarly, the scenes between a spell-bound, besotted 
Rinaldo and Armida on her magical island recall the similar relationship
 between Ruggiero and Alcina in <i>Orlando Furioso</i>.
</p><p>
It may partly have been the tinsel Addison criticised that made this 
story so highly favoured. In a period concerned to found modern forms on
 classical precedent, opera was an irrational entertainment in which the
 patently unnatural prospect of carrying on a story in song could be 
justified by claims first for the classical origins of the practice, and
 then by the assertion that, as mythical or Arcadian characters probably
 sang for much of the time anyway, having them sing on the modern stage 
was allowable. John Dryden&#8217;s love of the genre offered a description of 
opera in 1685 which accounted equally for opera&#8217;s use of song and for 
the preponderance of scenic spectacle: &#8216;Humane Impossibilities, are to 
be received, as they are in Faith; because where Gods are introduced, a 
Supreme Power is to be understood; and second Causes are out of doors. 
Opera theoretically had free reign to please the Hearing and the eye, 
rather than to gratify the understanding; throughout the seventeenth and
 eighteenth centuries in England and elsewhere there was bitter and 
earnest complaint that such an art form, given over entirely to sensual 
delights, enervated and emasculated its adherents, and propelled the 
degeneration of society as a whole.&#8217;
</p><p>
Not all critics of opera wished the genre simply to be abandoned in 
favour of more manly British entertainments, however. Some held out hope
 for reform of the genre, and among these Aaron Hill was surely one of 
the most active. Hill it was who in 1732 famously begged Handel to write
 operas in English, and so give the nation&#8217;s music-lovers something they
 could truly understand. This plea undoubtedly was meant to recall to 
Handel his own collaboration with Hill on his first opera for London, <i>Rinaldo</i>. <i>Rinaldo</i>
 was the first Italian opera written specifically for an English 
audience (though Londoners were already familiar with the genre from 
Italian pasticcio and bilingual operas), and despite his use of Tasso&#8217;s 
tinsel, Hill&#8217;s adaptation of this story has grounding in contemporary 
indigenous theatrical practice, particularly the semi-opera. As Curtis 
Price has explained, the first audiences for <i>Rinaldo</i> would have recognised its 
similarity to George Granville&#8217;s <i>The British Enchanters</i>
 (1706), which also featured a love-hate relationship between a 
sorceress and a hero and scenic parallels with other English operas. 
They would additionally have noted the description of Handel as the 
&#8216;Orfeo del nostro Secolo&#8217; by Hill&#8217;s co-author, Giacomo Rossi, and 
doubtless recalled the epithet then popularly attached to Purcell, the 
&#8216;British Orpheus&#8217;. Possible political allusions (or at least political 
interpretations), reflecting the contention for the English throne 
between the Catholic pretender and Protestant Queen Anne, would also 
have been in keeping with English semi-opera.
</p><p>
<i>Rinaldo</i> belongs equally to the Continental tradition, however. In
 their use of an episode from a famous work, Hill and Rossi followed the
 standard practice of opera seria, which re-worked classic stories well 
known to the Latin- and Greek-educated aristocratic audiences. In such 
operas, it was the nuance given to the traditional version of a story 
that interested audiences (and that could then be given political 
interpretation). Appreciation of the subtlety of such nice variations no
 doubt helped shore up a sense of the opera as an exclusive, 
aristocratic club. This social context may help explain why the same 
stories (and often the same librettos) were set over and over again in 
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
</p><p>
Perhaps more importantly, if audience members knew the story backwards, 
they could be freed from following the plot, and left to enjoy the 
music. While the stories of opera seria provide some sense of historical
 continuity, it&#8217;s ironic that musical continuity or what we might think 
of as musical integrity is almost completely lacking. The singers&#8217; 
domination of the operatic stage meant that every new production of an 
opera had to be tailored to fit the needs and requirements of a new 
cast. So the 1731 revival of <i>Rinaldo</i> saw many arias transposed, 
or allocated to different characters, while Handel also took the 
opportunity to bring in popular songs from other of his operas, 
particularly <i>Lotario</i> and <i>Partenope</i>. How much violence he was doing to his 1711 
original is arguable, given that the first <i>Rinaldo</i> had also featured large amounts of 
borrowed material. The audiences were appreciative, nonetheless.
