<b>Purcell Edition Vol. 4 CD Review</b>

<img src="upload/purcell-instrumental-small.jpg" alt="purcell-instrumental-small.jpg" class="imgleft" height="240" width="240"> Issued by <a href="http://www.warnerclassicsandjazz.com/release.php?release=5787">Warner</a> in June 2009, Volume 4 of the <i>Purcell Edition</i>
 includes two re-issues of Christopher's Decca L'Oiseau-Lyre recordings 
on CDs 2 and 3 of this 5 CD set featuring other artists such as 
Harnoncourt, Leonhardt, Gardiner and Baumont. The recordings continue to
 receive excellent reviews many years after their recording:
</p><p>
"Discs two and three are however the heart of the matter as regards 
instrumental music. The Twelve Sonatas of Three Parts are played by 
Beznosiuk, Podger, Coin and Hogwood, recordings made in 1995 and still 
very much a living part of the Purcell chamber discography of choice. 
The individual movements of the sonatas are not separately tracked but 
that&#8217;s of little account, so warm and zesty is the playing, so 
rhythmically vital and imaginative too. Let&#8217;s just cite the refinement 
of the Presto of the second sonata and of the phrasal breadth of the 
same work&#8217;s Adagio. The lightly etched dissonances of the D minor [No.3]
 or the noble tread of the Sonnata opening to No.6 are two more 
exemplars of the instrumental and expressive excellences achieved by 
this ensemble. 
</p><p>
The Ten Sonatas in Four Parts were played by Catherine Mackintosh and 
Monica Huggett with, once again, Coin and Hogwood. The recording date 
back to 1982 and was an LP staple. The playing here is of robust 
sensitivity, and impressive, the two star fiddlers acquitting themselves
 with distinction. The Canzona of the B minor [No. 1] is a perfect 
example of the control and balance of the playing whilst the richly 
etched dynamism and rhythmic lift of the Vivace of No.7 attests to the 
drama of the performances." Jonathan Woolf, <a href="http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2010/Apr10/Purcell_instrumental_2564691390.htm"><i>www.musicweb-international.com</i></a></p>

<b><i>Balli per Cembalo</i> review</b>
</p><p>
<img src="upload/hh75_cover_front-1-1.jpg" alt="hh75_cover_front-1-1.jpg" class="imgright imgdarkborder" height="198" width="280">Christopher has also recently received praise for his "exemplary" editing work of <i>Balli per Cembalo</i>, published by <a href="http://www.editionhh.co.uk/hh75cat.htm">Edition HH</a>
 in 2007. "This is the first modern edition of the pieces in their 
original note values and also included is the illuminating information 
on proportional notation...There is a comprehensive critical commentary 
containing an invaluable concordance of these dances with lute sources 
in particular". John Collins, <i>Harpsichord &amp; fortepiano</i>.
