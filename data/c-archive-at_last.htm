It is the first time that the complete ballet music,
 written in 1927, has been published; the suite drawn from this material
 by the composer, and published in 1930 is also included in this new 
publication, which is based on the autograph material in addition to the
 earlier printing.

</p><p>
Although the first publication of the suite misleadingly described it as
 being a &#8220;suite pour orchestre&#8221;, the scoring of the ballet is for a 
remarkably economic sextet: clarinet, bassoon, trumpet, violin, cello 
and piano.

</p><p>
In addition, Martin&#367; also arranged the suite as a piano solo; a new edition of this is still in preparation. Watch this space&#8230;.
