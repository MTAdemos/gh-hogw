 Christopher's four "symphony quintetto" editions already issued, this 
new volume of one of Haydn&#8217;s favourite works, as arranged by John Peter 
Salomon (the composer's concert-master), is the first modern publication
 in full score with parts, and uses the recently discovered autograph.

</p><p>
Scored for flute, string quartet and keyboard, the arrangement 
convincingly brings the grandness of an orchestral symphony to a chamber
 setting. The keyboard contribution is optional, though effective, and 
the ingenuity with which the strings and flute accommodate Haydn&#8217;s full 
orchestral writing is a genuine tribute to Salomon&#8217;s skill. 

</p><p>
A significant addition to the repertoire of sociable Hausmusik, this 
fine arrangement will also be a delight for professionals in concert.
