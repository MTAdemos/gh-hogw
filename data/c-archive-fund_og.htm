THE COPENHAGEN CONNECTION: RESOURCES FOR CLAVICHORD PLAYERS IN 18TH&#8211;CENTURY DENMARK<br>
<br>
It is dangerously easy to try to shrink the concept of Danish arts
during the 18th-century to fit the area we know today as Denmark.
At that time the Danish King&#8217;s realm stretched southwards to include the
 Danish-German Duchy of Schleswig and the German Duchy of Holstein, and
outwards to the Faroes, Iceland, and Greenland. To the north, the state
of Norway was a province of the Danish kingdom from 1536 to 1814, with
no royal court or nobility of its own and closely dependant on the
cultural activities of Copenhagen.

</p><p>
It might be expected that, as a result, the country would be merely
reactive to German fashion and changes &#8211; with the exception of a strong
interest in congregational church music in the vernacular (the many <i>Koralbog</i>
 manuscripts extant bear witness to this constant in Danish musical
life). In fact a closer examination shows a continuing determination not
 to be a backwater; early initiatives in music publishing, many academic
 and cultural societies, flourishing performances both in civic and
court circles and an openness of access to musical instruction and
critical thought indicate a dynamism that is usually overlooked by
mainstream histories that plot music of the 18th-century on a
Vienna-Berlin-Paris axis.

</p><p>
To map the territory in terms of &#8220;clavichord awareness&#8221; we first need to
 look at the presence of the instruments themselves, and the publication
 of &#8216;Klaveer&#8217; methods and periodicals offering suitable music, before
selecting a few composers to present in the context that has been
created. As in all such surveys at this period, it is the printed
material rather than the individual manuscripts, the listings of
instruments 'then' rather than the chance survivors in museums 'now'
that most influence the picture.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>

</p><p>
The clavichord had already permeated Danish society in the previous
century. At the highest level we find Christian IV and his consort
employing Melchior Schildt in 1626-7 to teach their children the
clavichord.(1) Royal letters mention the need for replacement strings,
and by 22 July 1632 they are searching for &#8220;a decent fellow who can play
 the clavichord or virginal, and who can wait upon the children&#8230;&#8221;(2)

</p><p>
At less elevated levels of society, a recent study of the probate
accounts for town musicians in Denmark from 1618 to 1829, covering some
170 professional <i>stadsmusikanter</i> has revealed the statistics of
clavichord ownership.(3) From the 170 musicians accounted for (both town
 musicians and organists) a total of 78 &#8220;claveer&#8221; are listed, (some
&#8220;small&#8221;, some &#8220;old&#8221;, some &#8220;double&#8221; and 14 provided with pedal); the
imaginative early spellings include &#8220;Clauff Kordium&#8221;, &#8220;Clacordium&#8221;,
&#8220;Klaufcordtium&#8221; and &#8220;Covcordium&#8221; &#8211; even the mysterious &#8220;ClimCordium&#8221; and
 &#8220;Cemi Cordium&#8221; in 1625 &#8211; before settling to &#8220;clavichordium&#8221; and
eventually &#8220;claveer&#8221; after 1700. Danish town musicians, unlike their
colleagues in Germany, were responsible for the purchase of their own
instruments, which may account for the very few harpsichords listed (a
&#8220;Cymbal&#8221; in 1729, a spinet in 1739, and three entries for &#8220;Clavis
Cymbal&#8221; or &#8220;Clausumbal&#8221; between 1761 and 1780). Even in the year this
survey terminates, 1829, a &#8220;claveer&#8221; is recorded.

</p><p>
Another rich source of information on transactions in domestic
instruments are the advertisements in the <i>Adresseavisen</i>;(4) the
last advertisement to mention a clavichord, in 1842 (No. 223) states:
&#8220;Et Klaveer eller simplet Fortepiano &#248;nskes tilkj&#248;bs&#8221; (A Clavier or
simple Fortepiano wanted). Two adverts in 1834 (Nos. 218 an 224) offered
 a clavichord for sale, and both times it was described as being a
suitable instrument for a beginner(5). The anonymity of these references
 is balanced by the fact that Constanze Mozart, who lived for ten years
in Copenhagen with her second husband, Georg Nissen, wrote to her son
Carl in Milan on 13 November 1810 that &#8220;My dear Nissen is having one of
Stein&#8217;s [pianofortes] sent to me from Vienna, but it&#8217;ll probably be
early next year before I get it, so in the meantime I&#8217;ll have to make do
 with a clavichord&#8230; &#8220;.(6) It is salutary to picture Constanze, twenty
years after Mozart&#8217;s death, and the wife of an international diplomat,
still playing the clavichord!

</p><p>
Of the extensive tablature and MS collections that are preserved in
Denmark, it is important to note some of the most significant items,
although it is largely the later, printed material which can better
indicate the broader public preferences and changes of taste.

</p><p>
Three mid-17th century tablatures deserve mention for their
international repertoire: the Obmaus Tablature (Ny kgl. Saml. 1997 fol),
 the tablature additions to the Voigtl&#228;nder <i>Oden und Lieder</i> (mu
6703.2131/6) and the &#8220;Copenhagen Tablature&#8221; (Gl. kgl. Saml. 376
fol.).(7) All of these mix chorale settings and psalm tunes with embryo
suites and dance movements, including some melodies familiar from
English
virginalists&#8217; repertoire, and many French dances, with original
fingering and ornamentation.

</p><p>
The French connection is even more marked in two later tablatures
connected with the Copenhagen organist Johan Lorentz:(8) Berlin Deutsche
 Staatsbibliothek (Mus. ms. 40623) and University Library Uppsala (Ihre
284 and Ihre 285); the first of these, dated 1678, is described as <i>Clavicordium Buch</i>
 on its final page and contains music by Krieger, La Barre, Lorentz,
Lully, Schop, Strie, Brolard and Manoir, again with fingering and
ornamentation. The two MSS now in Uppsala were assembled by Thomas
Nilsson Ihre while a university student in Copenhagen 1677-8, and,
according to Jan Olof Rud&#233;n, reflect contemporary musical practice in
Denmark.(9) From here it is
a short step to the more familiar suites and variations of Dieterich
Buxtehude (1637-1707), who left Denmark in 1688 after spending his
childhood and youth in Elsinor and Helsingborg. Only one of his works is
 attributed to those early years, and since he published none of his
keyboard music, we are dependent on what has survived in the D&#252;ben and
L&#252;beck tablatures in particular. Mattheson&#8217;s 1739 mention
of the (lost) seven suites &#8220;on the nature and quality of the planets&#8221; is specially intriguing.

</p><p>
Other miscellaneous Danish manuscript notebooks from 1688 to
as late as 1820 are listed and analysed by Koudal,(10) and the incipits
of many tablature items now preserved in Swedish collections are listed
in Rud&#233;n.

</p><p>
<i>Published sources</i>
</p><p>
The range of didactic literature that was published during the
eighteenth century shows that while German texts were available (and
later also appeared in translation), Copenhagen saw the publication of
the first Scandinavian music method by Carl August Thielo in 1746 and
instructions on chorale playing (F.C. Breitendich 1766, 1776), and
Norway produced the very individual scientific investigations of
J.D.Berlin (1744, 1767) in addition to the expected texts aimed at
beginners. Towards 1800 Danish translations appeared of German writings
on singing, keyboard playing and tuning (Hiller, T&#252;rk, G.F. Wolf and
Barthold Fritz). A summary chronological listing follows, plus a few comments:

</p><p>
1700 Friedrich Erhard Niedt:<br>
<i>Musicalische Handleitung oder: Grundlicher Unterricht. Vermittelst
welchen ein Liebhaber der edlen Music in kurzer Zeit sich so weit
perfectioniren kan, dass er nicht allein den General-Bass nach denen

folglich allerley Sachen selbst componiren
und ein rechtschaffener Organist und Musicus heissen konne. Erster
Theil: Handelt vom General-Bass, denselben schlechtweg zu spielen</i> (Hamburg).

</p><p>
1706 Friedrich Erhard Niedt:<br>
<i>[Anderer Theil]: Handleitung zur Variation, wie man den General-Bass

verfertigen konne</i> (Hamburg).

</p><p>
1708 Friedrich Erhard Niedt:<br>
<i>Musicalisches A, B, C</i> (Hamburg).<br>
Niedt lived in Copenhagen as an organist from 1700 until his death in
1708, though he was published from Hamburg; J.S. Bach, amongst others,
borrowed from his <i>General-bass</i> method.

</p><p>
1744 Johan Daniel Berlin:<br>
<i>Musicaliske Elementer eller Anleedning til Forstand paa de f&#248;rste

A Breitkopf edition appeared two years later. Berlin also includes a
description of the monochord he invented and constructed in 1752.

It is interesting to note that, according to Schi&#248;rring, six copies of this tutor (a reworking of Johann Adam Hiller&#8217;s <i>Anweisung zur Singekunst</i>
 from 1773) survived up to the 20th century in six copies in the library
 of Helsingor Latin School, &#8220;evidence of their continued use in
theoretical education for well over a century&#8221;.(12)

The author of this anonymous work was identified by Gerber as
Johan Christoph Kleen ; the volume offers instruction on keyboard playing (including
the use of <i>Bebung</i> which is illustrated but not so named on p. 40) and also distinguishes between staccato dots and dashes.

Translation of Barthold Fritz&#8217;s <i>Anweisung, wie man Claviere, Clavecins und Orgeln, &#8230; stimmen k&#246;nne</i> of 1756.

</p><p>
Of these many sources, it is particularly useful for the clavichordist to take a closer look at Carl August Thiolo and his <i>Tanker og Regler</i> from 1746.

</p><p>
Thielo was born in Copenhagen, in 1707, a son of one of the town
organists, but from the age of eight until twelve he was sent to study
keyboard and thoroughbass playing in Germany, and became a pupil of J.G.
 Walther in Weimar. He returned to Copenhagen in 1726 as a music teacher
 and organist, and later formed an association with the dramatist Ludvig
 Holberg, wrote for the theatre and produced music periodicals and even
novels.

</p><p>
Thielo explains that in 1746 he was asked by &#8220;Det musikalaske Societet&#8221;
the Musical Society) &#8211; one of the many cultural societies that had been
established to counteract the recent lack of theatre life in that
pietistic period &#8211; to publish a &#8220;musical companion&#8221; with instruction
specifically in Danish. The brief of the Society was &#8220;to bring Music to
flower amongst our countrymen and to provide the public as well as the
society itself with an innocent pastime&#8221;, primarily through concerts but
 also through the advancement of musical instruction.

</p><p>
The volume is typeset, but to keep the cost down the author himself cut
the music examples in wood, with, as John Bergsagel puts it, &#8220;very
modest results&#8221;. This, &#8220;the first book about music in Danish to be
published in Copenhagen, provides in addition to its practical
information a lively picture of the Copenhagen musical scene in the
mid-18th century.&#8221;(14)

</p><p>
The contents listing of the first part confirms that Thielo is
addressing social as well as technical considerations, and that he is
aiming at the professional teacher as well as the enthusiastic amateur
listener:

</p><p>
Chap. 1: Music&#8217;s origin and progress to the present day, including the music of [King] David<br>
Chap. 2: The necessity of having music at all levels of society<br>
Chap. 3 : Contempt for, and misuse of, music<br>
Chap. 4 : How to improve your status in society with music<br>
Chap. 5 : What a clavier teacher must understand<br>
Chap. 6 : The neccessary qualities of one who would learn music
and how the information can most advantageously be organized(15)

</p><p>
The five chapters of the second part (pp. 16-34) cover technicalities &#8211; notation, rhythm and tempo, fingering (<i>Applicatio</i>), ornamentation and practical exercises. In the third part (pp. 35-58) he deals with harmony under the heading of <i>General-bass</i>, the fourth part
(pp. 59-72) &#8220;gives instruction in the art of singing and teaches pronunciation
of the Italian language&#8221;,16 and pages 73-86 contain &#8220;a Musical Lexicon
of the musical words, instruments and forms of composition in current
use. Also how one can learn to tune a Clavier&#8221;.(17)

</p><p>
Thielo writes from considerable experience of the local musical life (he
 begins by pointing out that he is writing in &#8220;the twentieth year since I
 came to Denmark&#8221;),(18) and engages with all areas where music is to be
found &#8211; including &#8220;music in the royal household, opera, music to
encourage the army, and also music for the student&#8221;, where, he says &#8220;it
is almost as important as books, because when the brain of the student
is exhausted then it will be refreshed by music; if, instead of books he
 can take up an instrument and play, this will refresh and cheer his
spirits and encourage him to read&#8221; (p.7).19 He criticises the misuse of
music largely on grounds of inappropriateness, the playing
of sacred music in secular surrounds, and vice versa (pp.8-9). He also
emphasises that, even for an amateur, music makes intellectual as well
as sensual demands: &#8220;A composer must have learned science (in this
context consider Graun, Handel, Scheibe, and Heinchen) and must be a
good orator; a good composer through his music must be able to able to
arouse <i>Affect</i> like an orator. For this purpose rules are
neccessary &#8211; but where can you learn them? Since you have not had the
opportunity to use your early years for such studies, read the Royal
Cappellmeister Scheibe&#8217;s <i>Critica Musica</i>; this learned man&#8217;s eloquence can better and more clearly cover the issue&#8230;&#8221; (p. 10).(20)

</p><p>
Social advice on refined behaviour in musical company follows:
&#8220;When an opportunity arises in any gathering to enjoy a musical master
performing on his instrument, it is impolite to continue talking or
making any other noise. If you disturb the peace and quiet, either by
walking about or coughing or beating out of time, then any master will
be disinclined to go on playing and feel distracted from what he is
otherwise so good at doing: and so his imagination becomes constrained
and his inspiration refuses to flow&#8221; (p. 11).(21)

</p><p>
Much of the volume is devoted to basic instruction, with a scheme of
tuition which Thielo recommends for both teachers and pupils (p. 15).
and finding the right notes on the keyboard. Then in the second month
one learns to &#8216;spell&#8217;, namely to play two parts together (with both
hands) and thereby find the necessary fingering.
&#8220;During the third month these skills should show some improvement, and
this is when one starts learning the more essential ornaments. Thus in
the fourth, fifth and sixth months one can learn many lighter pieces and
 the various metres and can after six months have come so far that the
student is no longer obliged to watch his fingers but looks only at the
notes and he can then be ready to learn <i>General-bass</i>.
And at the same time he can start to learn <i>galanterie</i> pieces.
When learning <i>General-bass</i>,
 the scholar should be very careful to pay attention to the key and the
modes, even though it takes time and care, since you have to know this
in advance, before you can go on.
&#8220;The scholar will be well advised to ask for written down rules from his
 teacher to study at home, since with so many hundreds of rules they
cannot be remembered by word of mouth alone, because they will as
quickly be forgotten.
&#8220;Some teachers direct students to [use] the French [violin] clef
which has one real advantage that both hands use the same system &#8211; the
right hand has G on the bottom line, and in the bass is equally a G on
the bottom line. But the French sign has its difficulties also because
one is constantly required to add below the bottom line two leger lines
to indicate notes such as F, E, D# &#8230; But so little music is actually
written using this clef that the student is obliged to transpose pieces,
 and yet if you ask in Denmark why they are teaching students to use
this clef they declare it is the easiest&#8221; (p. 14 bis, recte 16). Thielo
recommends starting with C [soprano] clef, although &#8220;the violin clef,
where the second line is G, some people consider even better, since it
is also already used to notate much keyboard music; in addition because
if you want to proceed to the flute or violin after learning the
keyboard, you would already know the necessary clef for those
instruments as well.&#8221;

</p><p>
On <i>Applicatio</i>, or fingering, he advocates use of the thumb in the
 modern manner: &#8220;When the student begins to play the clavier he must get
 used to holding his fingers rather more bent than stretched out. Note
that above all, the thumb must be held close to the index finger, in the
 course of playing mostly under the index finger. The thumb may well
come to be used in playing and not (as some antiquated players teach) to
 play with the four fingers without the thumb&#8221;.

</p><p>
Before the section on ornaments and <i>Manieren</i> Thielo gives
recommendations on fingering and explanations of interest to all
keyboard players; it is clear that these are aimed at the clavichord
player in particular:
&#8220;The <i>Trill</i>, as far as possible should be played with the third
and fourth fingers (counting the thumb as 1), but when 3 and 4 are not
convenient then use 2 and 3.(22)
&#8220;The <i>Vorschlag</i> is again an ornament which all fingers of the right hand should practice.
&#8220;When several notes are struck at once then all fingers should be
equally strong so that each tone can be clearly heard [i.e. this implies
 a touch-sensitive instrument]. All running notes should be struck
evenly and equally.

</p><p>
&#8220;When one plays [scales] with the right hand ascending or descending,
then the following fingers are used (in the right hand the thumb is 1);
1234 1234. Some practise crossing the fingers, for example a 3 crossing
over 4 when going up, which is awkward. Nevertheless it can be done, but
 with the reservation that it is usually done with semitones, because of
 the shorter [keys for the] half notes, since one can&#8217;t use the thumb
there.
</p><p>
&#8220;It is impossible to give examples of all the places that will occur
otherwise this chapter would be much too long&#8230; you should not however
consider it a lapse on my part if I simply give you this general rule &#8211;
Consider first the piece you are going to play and when you have studied
 it, so chose the fingering with which you can manage it without
difficulty&#8221;.
</p><p>
The following comments on ornaments have been rearranged from Thielo&#8217;s
rather discursive descriptions, to bring all references to one ornament
together.

</p><p>
&#8220;The <i>trill</i> is a very well-known ornament and it is performed as
follows: you take a note and the adjacent one, a whole or half tone
above depending on the tonality you are dealing with, and play these two
 keys quickly, the one after the other. A number of students do it well
enough, but others do it too slowly which one must practise since a good
 trill is very pretty. It consists of major second, and a trilletto (as
the Italians call it) uses a minor second&#8221;. Later, in the section
devoted to singing (p. 67) Thielo incorrectly describes a trill with a
minor (&#8220;small&#8221;) second as a tremuletto (<i>recte</i> trilletto), and
explains that &#8220;the trill with major second sounds sharper, the trilletto
 with the minor second sounds milder and more gentle&#8221;.<br>
&#8220;For the <i>Vorschlag</i> or <i>Accent</i>: you touch the note a half or
 whole tone above or below, depending on the key, quickly before you
strike the main note. Usually this note lying above or below is played
very legato.

</p><p>
A Vorschlag from above can be used when there are two or three repeated notes,<img class="imgright whiteborder" src="upload/MusEx1.jpg">
<br clear="all">
or as a sliding accent, where you hold the B natural longer than the C:<img class="imgright whiteborder" src="upload/MusEx2.jpg">
<br clear="all">

A <i>Vorschlag</i> is always done after the trill at a cadence [i.e.= anticipation]:<img class="imgright whiteborder" src="upload/MusEx3.jpg">
<br clear="all">
</p><p>
The <i>Slide</i> is made from a third above or below and played quickly
upwards or downwards towards the main note so that the main note holds
its accent and force. A <i>Slide</i> thus consists of a third&#8230;

</p><p>
A <i>Slide</i> is used when the melody has intervals of a third or more, either rising or falling:<br>
<img class="imgleft whiteborder" src="upload/MusEx4.jpg">
<br clear="all">

</p><p>
The <i>Mordent</i> is best illustrated with notes as in the example given here, where the accent is on the last note:<img class="imgright whiteborder" src="upload/MusEx5.jpg"><br clear="all">
</p><p>
A <i>Mordent</i> is also done in this way:<img class="imgright whiteborder" src="upload/MusEx6.jpg"><br clear="all">
</p><p>
A <i>Mordent</i> is indicated with <i>m</i> over the note.
</p><p>
A <i>Mordent</i> is mainly used on the first note of the bar<img class="imgright whiteborder" src="upload/MusEx7.jpg"><br clear="all">

</p><p>
It is also used when many repeated notes follow each other; then you
find this expected [as in the example above, Thielo seems to interpret a
 turn or gruppetto as an appogiatura attached to a mordent]:<img class="imgleft whiteborder" src="upload/MusEx8.jpg"><br clear="all">

</p><p>
A <i>Trill</i> is abbreviated as &#8220;tr&#8221;, a trilletto as &#8220;t.&#8221;
</p><p>
A <i>Trill</i> may be used &#8230; on the second half of a tied note, or often four trills one after another:
</p><p>
<img class="imgleft whiteborder" src="upload/MusEx9.jpg"><br clear="all">
</p><p>
<i>Passagi</i> are &#8216;transitions&#8217; or quick runs, and occur both step-wise or jump-wise, either ascending or descending:<img class="imgleft whiteborder" src="upload/MusEx10.jpg"><br clear="all">

</p><p>
<i>Passagi</i> are used in the course of slow pieces with jumps.
If you want to use these ornaments observe this essential rule &#8211;
Note well the required sharps or flats; learn to note the key carefully,
 so that one uses these ornaments correctly and do not mix up the notes
and by mistake play C for C# etc.
</p><p>
<i>Tremuletto</i> is a vibrato or <i>Bebung</i> [Bevning], and therefore
 it is to be included among the ornaments. It sounds decorative when it
occurs in the right place and in such pieces as offer something sad or
melancholy or moving; but in cheerful and humorous pieces it is better
to use another ornament. This vibrating [Bev&#230;gning] (in Italian called <i>Tremuletto</i>),
 is done in the following manner: you depress the key firmly, then let
the finger on the note that is being held gently waver, so that the
string of the held note is alternately pressed harder and softer, at the
 same time taking care not to press the string so hard that it breaks.

</p><p>
Some keyboard players cannot touch a key on the clavier without a bad
habit of having to press it so that the most cheerful pieces sound like
laments [&#8220;lamentabile&#8221;]. Many organists use this touch also on the organ
 from habit, but pointlessly, since the organ sounds no better for it.

</p><p>
On the clavicembalo this device is of no use, but only on the
wellsounding clavier and then only when well done. Many claviers do not
allow their tone to produce a vibrato or tremulo, not even if one treads
 on them with one&#8217;s feet.(23)
</p><p>
One school of thought amongst clavier players holds that whenever you
play a note without adding an ornament you commit a terrible crime, and
they thus ruin the entire line by adding ornaments so excessively, one
can hardly recognise the melody of the piece. One would be pleased if
they used their ornamental skills in the right places, but where a trill
 should be played, there they play a Mordent, and instead of a <i>Vorschlag</i> or <i>Accent</i>
they play a slide, and they shake the tones (specially with <i>Tremuletti</i>)
 so pathetically that one would imagine one was hearing the echo of a
half-starving pack of wolves in coldest winter; nevertheless Mon Maitre
plays incomparably! For my part, howl as loud as you like, but do not
impose it indiscriminately on others. As the scholars say: &#8220;Ulula cum
lupis cum quibus esse cupis&#8221;
[howl with the wolves if you want to join them].
</p><p>
Well-applied ornaments decorate a piece, and are just as essential there
 as spices are in food. There can be more and even fancier ornaments
especially when a singer or instrumentalist ends a movement with a <i>Cadenze</i> (cadence or cadenza), but these I must discuss elsewhere,
because for this a proficient and thorough knowledge of <i>General- bass</i> (harmony) is essential&#8221;.

</p><p>
In the concluding Lexicon, Thielo presents some useful definitions for
the clavichord player, as well as some rather surprising misconceptions:
 the Clavichordium(24) or Clavier is &#8220;an instrument with metal strings,
very perfect, and the best on which to learn the elements of music&#8221;,
while the Spinet is, surprisingly, &#8220;a musical instrument with tangents;
this instrument is no longer in use and instruments of this
type are no longer made.&#8221; This is possibly explained by his double
definition of tangents as &#8220;plectra on harpsichords, used to create the
sound, but in claviers a piece of brass which touches the strings&#8221;. He
also covers terms such as &#8220;Bundfry&#8221;, &#8220;Cembalo&#8221; (&#8220;a long musical
instrument in the form of a wing, and is played like a Clavier&#8221;), and
repeats the definitions given above for Tremuletto, Trillo and
Trilletto.

</p><p>
Thielo&#8217;s German instruction volume, <i>Grund-Regeln</i> (see the list above) came out seven years later than the <i>Tanker og Regler</i>, in 1753 (the same year that C.P.E. Bach published the first edition of his <i>Versuch</i>). It is far from being a translation of the Danish volume, as often stated, although
it covers the same territory. <i>Grund=Regeln wie man, be&#255; weniger Information, sich selbst die Fundamenta der Music und des Claviers, lernen Kan</i>
 contains additional and corroborative information which can be added to
 the comments already selected from the earlier volume; the musical
examples are more extensive, and also better engraved.
After again recommending the clavichord as the ideal introduction to
other keyboard types (&#8220;A beginner should first practise on the
clavichords, because if he should start playing on the spinet, or
harpsichord or positive organ which are harder to play, he would become
used to a rough and hard manner of playing&#8221;, p. 32),25 Thielo adds to
his comments on ornaments [p. 51] (the <i>Trillo</i> is done in the left hand with the thumb and second finger, for example), reiterates that
the <i>Trillo</i> covers a whole tone, the <i>Trilletto</i> a semitone, and adds that when using <i>Bebung</i>
 the player should vibrate until the note ends.(26) Again he points out
that it cannot be done on a bad clavichord, &#8220;nor on organs and other
instruments&#8221; (p. 55). Most usefully he includes two musical examples at
this point, the first to indicate where <i>Bebung</i> should be applied
to a melodic line and the second to show a suitable application of all
the ornaments he has discussed, including vibrato (p.63); in each case
he indicates <i>Bebung</i> with a small &#8220;b&#8221; above the note.

</p><p>
<i>Periodicals</i><br>
<br>
Just as a study of the first Scandinavian music periodical, the Swedish <i>Musikaliskt Tidsf&#246;rdrif</i>,
 gives an indication of the parameters of public taste over nearly
thirty years in Stockholm (1789-1823),27 a similar overview can be
achieved from a summary of the leading Copenhagen periodicals for the
Danish musical public. The major publisher was S&#248;ren S&#248;nnischen, who was
 already active in 1789, when he published
the continuation of Cramer&#8217;s <i>Magazin der Musik</i> (Hamburg, 1783-6) in Copenhagen under the simple title of <i>Musik</i>; it survived one year, from 1789 to 1790. More lasting was his answer to <i>Musikaliskt Tidsf&#246;rdrif</i>,
titled <i>Apollo</i>, which ran from 1795 to 1808. Other periodicals of interest to the clavier player from various publishers were <i>Eunomia</i> (1803-1810), intended for &#8220;harp or clavier&#8221;, <i>Nordens Apollo</i> (1804, edited by Philip Barth, and from 1805-9 by Claus Nielsen Schall), followed
by <i>Nye Apollo</i>, which ran from 1814-1827, but after 1818 added &#8220;et Maaneds Skrift for Pianoforte&#8221; to its title, and <i>Polyhymnnia</i>
 (c 1806- 10) issued by F.L.Ae. Kunzen, and containing few keyboard
pieces, and these mostly arrangements (marches, polonoises) from
Kunzen&#8217;s
stage works.
Of these publications, <i>Apollo</i>, subtitled <i>Et musikalsk Maanedsskrivt for Sang og Klaveer af forskiellige Componister</i>. and, to a lesser extent, <i>Nordens Apollo</i> are of most interest to the solo keyboard player. In an advance advertisement of 4 March 1795 the publisher of <i>Apollo</i>
 praises first the vocal pieces and choice of poetry he will be offering
 in his periodical, then the keyboard music including both &#8220;easy and
difficult [<i>lette og svaere</i>] Sonatas, Fantasies,
Galanterie-pieces, plus airs with variations and arrangements of
overtures from operas&#8221;. Out of 129 works for Clavier, one finds 22
sonatas or sonatinas, 26 sets of variations, 25 rondos, 26 separate
dances and marches, four &#8220;tone-paintings&#8221; (these include rudimentary
battle pieces) and 24 miscellaneous movements (chaconne, divertissement,
 pastorale, etc.).28 Other periodicals from this period either contain
nothing but vocal numbers or are specifically addressed to the
&#8220;Pianoforte&#8221; rather than &#8220;Klaveer&#8221; in their titles.

</p><p>
Like <i>Musikaliskt Tidsf&#246;rdrif, Apollo</i> demonstrates the same nice
balance between local and international composers, with a similar
preference for arrangements over original works, sonatas and theme and
variations winning; we note the usual 18th-century delight in
arrangements of overtures, which rarely make very effective keyboard
solos, but no doubt added an air of expectancy to a musical evening. The
 larger format and engraving of <i>Apollo</i> was certainly more spacious and
impressive than <i>Musikaliskt Tidsf&#246;rdrif</i>, and also less easily portable.(29) For a summary of the solo keyboard contents of the first four parts, see Appendix I.

</p><p>
S&#248;ren S&#248;nnischen&#8217;s other output as a music publisher from 1784-1818 can
be seen in the catalogues reconstructed by Dan Fog,(30) but apart from
the <i>Kort Klaverskole</i> (1791 and later editions), and a four-volume series of <i>Lette Sonater</i> from 1788-1811, he otherwise published little original keyboard music.

</p><p>
Advertisements from the other Copenhagen music dealers indicate that
there was little time-lag between the appearance of the most important
German publications for clavier and their being available in Denmark.
Friedrich Christian Pelt&#8217;s catalogue(31) (1784-6) lists the printed
music holdings of the firm, with over 40 items for &#8220;clavecin eller
fortepiano&#8221; and 59 for &#8220;sang med klaver&#8221;.(32) Amongst them we find a
wide range of German publications for solo clavier including major
collections of C.P.E. Bach, Georg Benda, Doles, Forkel, H&#228;ssler, Haydn,
Kirnberger, L&#246;hlein, Podbielski, Reichardt, Rosenbaum, Seydelmann, T&#252;rk,
 and E.W. Wolf. (Interestingly, the only Mozart listed is Leopold, with
his <i>Violinschule</i>.)
</p><p>
<i>Composers</i><br>
<br>
At this point it might help to itemise alphabetically a few of the
composers who were more closely associated with Denmark and whose works
have been overshadowed by the compositions that originated from Berlin,
Leipzig and Vienna. The influence of C.P.E. Bach and his circle can
immediately be deduced, but also a more eclectic parentage (Benda,
Haydn, the writings of Kirnberger and Marpurg, and even early signs of
an antiquarian enthusiasm for J.S. Bach) plus an increasing interest in
things Nordic (even the title of <i>Nordens Apollo</i> hints at a movement that was already gathering strength in Scandinavia).

</p><p>
<i>Johan Daniel Berlin</i> (1714-87) was Norwegian born, went to
Copenhagen for study in 1730 and returned to Trondheim in 1737. He wrote
 on many subjects in addition to music (including meteorology and
astronomy), arranged concerts, composed, and built instruments. (He was
also for many years the head of the city fire-service and inspector
of the city waterworks.) One of his instrumental inventions was a
mechanism (now lost) which produced a touch sensitive version of his
Hass harpsichord. In addition to his two treatises listed above, his
keyboard works consist of <i>Musicalisches Divertissement &#8230; nach modernen Gusto f&#252;r das Clavier gesetzen Sonatina</i> (published in Augsburg 1751), an Allegro in D major, an Aria in C major and eight minuets.

</p><p>
His son <i>Johann Heinrich [Henrik] Berlin</i> (1741-1807) left a
Sonatina and a Sonata, both in B flat, a set of six variations, two
minuets and two polonaises. For the works of both these composers see <i>The Music of the Berlin Family in Trondheim, Norway</i>.(33)
<i>Erich Ove Friling (c. 1772-1835)</i> was born in Norway, but is first
 found listed as a music dealer in Copenhagen in 1799, offering &#8220;good
music for Claveer&#8221; by Mozart, Hoffmeister and Pleyel; he also acquired a
 license to hire and sell musical instruments. In 1810 he offered for
hire &#8220;A good Fortepiano and a contra F. Clavier&#8221;.(34) After a business
trip in the same year he announced himself as returned and &#8220;now begin my
 teaching again on Claveer or Fortepiano&#8221;,(35) and as late as 1813
he offers &#8220;a very good Fortepiano by a famous foreign master and a ditto
 Claveer for sale&#8221;.(36) Of his compositions, the earlier examples
include a mention of Claveer alongside Fortepiano, including <i>Caracteristiske Stykker for Fortepiano eller Klaveer</i> (Characteristic Pieces for Fortepiano or Clavier [1812]), <i>Tolv Variationer paa det bekiendte Thema: Ach!
du lieber Augustin for Fortepiano eller Klaveer</i> (Twelve variations on the wellknown tune: Ach! Du lieber Augustin for Pianoforte or Clavier), and <i>Slaget ved Wagram. Et musikalsk Malerie for Fortepiano eller Klaveer</i> (A Musical Painting for Fortepiano or Clavier), a battle piece of little sophistication advertised in 1809.
<i>Johann Foltmar (c. 1714-1794)</i> in his <i>VI Morquien ganz neue und auserlesen&#8230;singm&#228;&#223;ig eingerichtet vors Clavier&#8230;</i>
 (Schmid, N&#252;rnberg c1775) gives the option of adding a flute or violin
to the melodic line, and also adds a table of ornaments with several
unusual items, including an abbreviation for <i>Bebung</i>; <img class="imgright whiteborder" src="upload/MusEx11.jpg">however, the sign occurs only twice in the

pieces, once on a long note with prefix, and once on a semi-quaver!<br clear="all">

</p><p>
<i>Christian Franz Severin H&#228;gemann (c. 1724-1812)</i> is an example of a
 German musician working in the court of Duke Friedrich Carl of
Schleswig-Holstein-Pl&#246;n who, when the Duchy of Pl&#246;n fell to Denmark in
1761, found himself incorporated into the court orchestra at Copenhagen.
 The manuscript of his <i>Clavier Versuche in sechs Sonaten</i> (1777) survives
in the Eutin Landesbibliothek (MS Mh 17), but there is no trace of the
twelve keyboard sonatas (in two manuscript volumes, 1782) mentioned by
Gerber(37).

</p><p>
In the 1777 sonatas the second movements (all Largo) are musically the
most enterprising and expressive, though throughout the set the writing
is right-hand dominated. The prescribed dynamics (not only &#8220;p&#8221; and &#8220;f&#8221;
but &#8220;pp&#8221; and &#8220;f. mezo&#8221;) indicate the clavichord, but there is no
technical gradation in the pieces and no hint of a &#8220;pedagogic method&#8221;.

</p><p>
<i>Adolph Carl Kunzen (1720-81)</i> was described by Johann Wilhelm
Hertel as &#8221;a fine and accurate clavichord player &#8230; even though not in
the Bach style, yet still in a good manner &#8230; and even more pleasing on
the harpsichord and clavichord than on the organ&#8221;.38 His <i>XII Sonatas for the Harpsichord&#8230;Opera Prima</i>
 were published in London in 1759 and a further six sonatas are found in
 manuscript in the Brussels Conservatoire (cat. 6125). In the Royal
Library Copenhagen are <i>3 Chorale f&#252;rs Clavier gesetzet&#8230; Erste Sammlung</i>
 with forte and piano indications (MS mu 6506.0934), and a Sonata in C#
minor (autograph (?), mu 6504.0730) with lavish dynamic markings (f,
ten, fz, poco f., ff, sf, cresc, pp) which might be equally at home on
the fortepiano.(39)

</p><p>
His son <i>Friedrich Ludwig Aemilius Kunzen (1761-1817)</i> was an associate of C.F. Cramer and J.A.P. Schulz, and later collaborated with Reichardt in editing the journal <i>Musikalisches Wochenblatt</i> (1791-2) and <i>Musikalische Monatsschrift</i> (1792). His keyboard works survive in contemporary anthologies such as <i>Musikalsk Nyeaarsgave for det smukke Ki&#248;n</i>
 (A Musical New Year Gift for the Fair Sex, 1798) &#8211; several sets of
variations, sequences of minuets, and a very fetching Poco Adagio and
Vivace in Book 1, all with full expressive dynamic markings. In the
preface to his <i>Weisen und Lyrische Ges&#228;nge</i> (1788) he states that he
wants his songs sung as written, without any of the fashionable
additions of trills and embellishments, which suggests that this was
exceptional for the period.

</p><p>
<i>Johann Gottfried Wilhelm Palschau (1741-1815)</i> was published by the enterprising Johann Haffner of Nurnberg in his serial <i>Oeuvres melees</i>
 (VI/6 and VII/4). He studied with M&#252;thel in Riga after having toured
internationally at the age of nine, playing &#8220;with great accuracy many of
 the most difficult compositions that have ever been written for keyed
instruments, particularly some lessons and double fugues by Sebastian
Bach&#8221;, as reported in London in 1779.(40) When C.P.E. Bach heard him, he
 was less complimentary, according to a letter of Matthias
Claudius (4 November 1768): &#8220;Palachau, said Bach, plays my
pieces badly, although his finger technique is beyond improvement, and
he plays pieces that are much more difficult than mine; but when he was
with me I always asked him to play pieces by my father where you only
had to hit the right notes&#8221;.(41) Like H&#228;ssler, Palschau eventually
found his way to Russia, where he also contributed variations to
<i>Suite des Airs Russes pour le clavecin ou Pianoforte par diverses auteurs</i>, published in St Petersburg between 1795 and 1800 and an <i>Air vari&#233; a quatre mains pour le Clavecin ou Piano Forte&#8230;</i> which claimed to be his Op. 1.

</p><p>
<i>Johann Adolf Scheibe (1708-76)</i> was another Copenhagen-born
musician, and director of the royal chapel from 1740 to 1748, though now
 mostly remembered for his hotly-argued critiques of J.S. Bach. It is a
reminder of the rural activity in Denmark that many of his manuscripts,
including several keyboard sonatas, were found in the private library
of Aalholm Manor on the island of Falster, collected by the music loving
 Count Otto Ludvig Raben in the latter half of the 18th century and
rediscovered in the 1990s (now held in the Royal Library), while two
others were published by Haffner in <i>Oeuvres melees</i> (III/6 and IV/5). He was recommended as a theorist by Thielo (see below).

</p><p>
<i>Johann Abraham Peter Schulz (1747-1800)</i> studied with Kirnberger,
but apparently not with C.P.E. Bach. He became a friend of Reichardt,
met Gr&#233;try and Haydn, and worked on J.G. Sulzer&#8217;s encyclopedia <i>Allgemeine Theorie der schonen Kunste</i> from 1771-74. (Schulz wrote all the music articles
from S to Z as well as assisting with and editing several others).

</p><p>
He was employed in Copenhagen as Hofkapellmeister and director of the
Royal Theatre (1787-95), and was the teacher of Weyse, Denmark&#8217;s first
virtuoso pianist/composer (see below). Schulz left a small number of
excellent and idiosyncratically varied keyboard works, of which the <i>Six diverses pi&#232;ces pour le Clavecin ou le Piano Forte&#8230; Oeuvre Premier</i>
 (Berlin and Amsterdam, 1776) are perhaps the most original &#8211; and
certainly one of the earliest publications to make mention of the
fortepiano on the title-page.(42)

</p><p>
The six pieces are in deliberately mixed and challenging styles,
and with an apparently arbitrary key-sequence (a, A, E, G, a, g); the
opening Prelude in the manner of a two-part invention constitutes a long
 tribute to the Baroque (an amalgam of the J.S. Bach <i>Duetti</i> and the <i>English Suites</i>
 springs to mind), while the Andante (IV) offers such endless Alberti
figuration that, with repeats taken into consideration, it must set a
record for persistence in this pattern. The Larghetto con Variazioni
(VI) opts for the extremes of <i>Empfindsamkeit</i>, with further
&#8216;compliments&#8217; to C.P.E. Bach in the form of varied reprises and a
penultimate variation that dissolves into figuration in the manner of a
Bach fantasy. One unsolved enigma is Schulz&#8217;s use of cryptogrammatic
inscriptions (G.B***, L.B***, W.S**) at the head of certain pieces. Are
these tributes or dedications, and are the works intended as <i>pi&#232;ces
characteristiques?</i>

</p><p>
The <i>Sonata per il Clavicembalo Solo&#8230; Opera Seconda</i> (Berlin, 1778) is, despite its title, more pianistic than Op. 1, but includes an intriguing table of ornaments (<i>Spiegazione dei segni</i>) showing both short and long trills starting on the written note.

</p><p>
<img class="imgleft whiteborder" src="upload/MusEx12.jpg"><br clear="all">


</p><p>
In addition we find a Sonatina pour le clavecin ou piano-forte [G] in
Lette Sonater og Smaa Haandstykker for Klaveret, af forskiellige
Mestere. 2det Stykke (Easy sonatas and small pieces for the Clavier by
various masters,1790), and several small pieces in anthologies, together
 with songs &#8220;beym Clavier&#8221; that make excellent keyboard solos, together
with a Largo for the fashionable glass harmonica.

</p><p>
<i>Israel Gottlieb Wernicke (1755-1836)</i>, the son of the organist of
Bergen Cathedral, was famed for playing the music of J.S. Bach, and
studied with Kirnberger (his translation of <i>Die Kunst des reinen Satzes</i>(43)
 into Danish was lost in the palace fire of 1794). From 1782-1784 he was
 Hofkapellmeister in Copenhagen (unsuccessfully, since he was opposed to
 new music), and teacher of the Norwegian organist and music pedagogue
Ole Andreas Lindeman (1769-1857). He described Haydn as a joker and
charlatan, and Mozart as &#8220;a mere naturalist, an incoherent and dirty
smearer&#8221;.(44) He was understandably fired and went to Kolding. His <i>Arietta con 50 variazioni: per il clavicembalo</i> (based on the folksong &#8220;Gestern Abend war Vetter Michael da&#8221;)(45) is patently
modelled on the Goldberg Variations, with canons, double and triple counterpoint and even pizzicato chords in the final <i>Marcia: Grave,</i>
 marked &#8220;ten&#8221; below and &#8220;pizz&#8221; above (with the note &#8220;Istedendfor
pizzicato for Klaveret brukes pedalen for piano-forte&#8221; &#8211; instead of
pizzicato on the Clavier use the pedal on the pianoforte) i.e. brushed
chords, as in F.W. Rust. &#8220;Tasto&#8221; is used as the indication to cancel
this instruction. In recommendation of these variations,
Wernicke (via an advertisment issued by his pupil Ole Lindeman)
claimed that &#8220;this work is so organized, that both hands may practisein
exactly the same way, so that no one who uses the work properly can
complain of an under-developed left-hand&#8221; (<i>Adresseavisen</i>, May 1797).(46)

</p><p>
<i>Christoph Ernst Friedrich Weyse, (1774-1842)</i> owned a Hass
clavichord of 1761,(47) and is described as &#8220;offenbar ein sp&#228;ter
Verehrer des Clavichords&#8221;.(48) He became a pupil of Schulz, on Cramer&#8217;s
advice, after failing to persuade C.P.E. Bach to teach him, and in 1791
took organ lessons from H.O.C. Zinck; by his own account he &#8220;played at
first the harpsichord and clavichord and only after many years of
practice acquired the touch needed for the Hammerklavier.&#8221; He mentions
J.S. Bach, Handel, C.P.E. Bach, Haydn, Mozart, Gluck and Schulz as
composers he &#8220;honours highly&#8221; (influences evident in his early music),
and while claiming that he was bored by most theoretical writers such as
 Fux and Kirnberger, he does admit that C.P.E. Bach&#8217;s <i>Versuch</i> interested him: &#8221;I leafed through it with considerable attention, and new to me in particular was the chapter on <i>Manieren</i>, most of which
I copied&#8221;.(49) See especially the volume of the Collected Piano
Works(50) where many of the MS pieces from his earlier years are
published for the first time; in particular a deliberately archaic
Allegro (possibly mirroring Schulz&#8217;s opening tribute in his <i>Six diverses pieces</i> mentioned above), several short fugues, and an extended Fantasia in D very closely modelled on the <i>Kenner und Liebhaber</i> examples of C.P.E. Bach. The
four earliest sonatas (Eb, A, F and C) were also probably intended for
the clavichord, and would provide an attractive counter-foil to C.P.E.
Bach and Haydn in recital.
</p><p>
<i>Hardenack Otto Conrad Zinck (1746-1832)</i> was a long-lived
German-trained composer, taught by C.P.E. Bach, who in 1777 was
recruited as first flautist and chamber musician in the court in
Schwerin. In August 1786 he visited Copenhagen, where he gave a highly
successful concert, and a year later took the post of <i>Singmeister</i>
 (first accompanist) in the Kongelige Kapel (where Schulz was the
Hofkapellmeister); he later also became organist at the Vor Frelsers
Kirke in Copenhagen (1789-1801). His four volumes of <i>Compositioner for Sangen og Claveret / Compositionen fur den Gesang und das Clavier</i>
 (1791-1793) contain lieder with German and Danish texts, as well as
sonatas and variations for keyboard, but it was the earlier set of <i>Sechs Clavier-Sonaten</i>, published
in 1783, three years before he settled in Copenhagen, that received
widespread encouragement from contemporary critics (and a substantial
subscription list of over 300 names, including Carl, Ernst and Friedrich
 Benda, Fasch, H&#228;ssler, Kunzen, Marpurg, Reichardt, Rust, T&#252;rk and E.W.
Wolf).
</p><p>
The <i>Hamburgischer Correspondent</i>, 18 November 1783, for example,
acknowledges the correctness of Zinck&#8217;s set and finds the sixth sonata
&#8220;the most original&#8221;, though the others do not lack for &#8220;his own turns of
 phrase and original expression&#8221;.(51)

</p><p>
C.F. Cramer writing in his <i>Magazin der Musik</i> (1783, col. 1259ff)
placed them amongst the best sonatas of their period, noting that they
&#8220;can certainly be spoken of in the same breath as the best by H&#228;ssler,
T&#252;rk and others. Their interesting melodic style, highly developed turns
 of phrase, great diversity of musical ideas unified into one great
sonata-style far removed from the routine, and finally, very descriptive
 tone-painting, elevate them and make them worthy of the approval of
connoisseurs&#8221;. To back his personal feelings for these sonatas,
Cramer quotes a letter from Schulz &#8220;in which he speaks of them
with all the enthusiasm that Herr Zinck&#8217;s work deserves, and through
which I became twice as fond of this artist whose theoretical gifts are
as great as his practical ones&#8221;.

</p><p>
The debt to C.P.E. Bach is also presented in a positive light: &#8220;One
can see very easily in whose spirit they were conceived. Those familiar
with Bach&#8217;s works will notice in various places a thorough study of this
 master, and as proof one need only highlight the whole treatment of the
 Rondo on page 10 [Sonata II], the transition into the Andante of the
third sonata, and various modulations within it, also some passages in
the Minuetto con espressione as well as various other ingenious devices
of modulation, modification of tempo and melodic
figures etc. But I am very far removed from making this observation as a
 criticism of Herr Zinck&#8217;s achievements. There is nothing which anyone
who imitates as he does deserves less than to be called a copyist; he
does not belong to the common herd, but only follows in these footsteps
as he himself follows in the footsteps of nature; and even if Herr Zinck
 did not posses as many individual qualities as is actually the case (I
would cite as proof the Allegro of Sonata II), he would be entitled to
apply to himself what Klopstock says of Horace, who undoubtedly, as a
poet, produced succesful recreations of far more Greek material than
this man, as a composer, has done of Bach&#8217;s&#8230; Should it not rejoice to
the core the heart of this worthy man [Bach]
to see so many examples (after H&#228;ssler this is the second striking one)
of the extent to which the superior part of his artistic contemporaries
attempt to emulate him, and how much his immortal work acts both as a
banner and as a standard marking the road to glory for composers of
sonatas.

</p><p>
From the very well written preface it becomes abundantly clear
that Herr Zinck is anything but a workaday, mechanical musician, but
rather someone who thinks about his art, and who knows to achieve great
aims not by blind groping but by planning them with care. I shall quote
it in full, because it provides the true point of view from which the
sonatas are to be considered, and at the same time welcome information
about the life and education of the composer. I at least am sufficiently
 interested by the individual who has given me happy hours of pleasure
to want to know rather more about him than simply what he is called; and
 I do not believe that anyone will interpret
this as vanity on Herr Zinck&#8217;s part or will fail to recognise within
it the outpouring of a heart filled with gratitude for others. I need
not repeat, after expressing my views so many times in this magazine, to
 what extent I am in full agreement with him concerning theoretical
ideas of what instrumental music should aim to achieve in respect of
characteristic and living expression, and so rarely does. It is simply a
 pleasure for me to be able to congratulate him on not contenting
himself with the knowledge of it, but actually bringing it to fruition.
</p><p>

[Here follows the text of Zinck&#8217;s Preface, which is translated at the end of this essay, p. 138]
</p><p>
Now a few more detailed remarks about these sonatas. There are six of
them, a number which, like the five acts of a tragedy, has become
established as almost the norm for such a collection; all based on very
different models, and not one which is not better than mediocre. The
Allegro of the first, in which the introduction at the end of the second
 page is especially distinguished, is followed by a short Grazioso of
the most lovely, flowing melody. It truly overflows with joy. How
delicately he restrains the melody in bars 5 and 21. The only thing
which stands out is the B in bar 10, which, it seems to me, would sound
better as an A, and is perhaps nothing more than a printing mistake.
Thereafter comes a very jolly Presto in 12/8.

</p><p>
I am almost tempted to rank the second sonata above all the others. The
way the notes race and chase after each other in the Allegro is
exquisite! The characteristic, recurring fall of a seventh in the
melody, and the entirely appropriate, joyful trill! One could listen
again and again to the Cantabile e sostenuto, which constitutes the
second movement, and it is a piece which tests a player&#8217;s musicality.
Every note of it has melody, nobility, meaning, and the sentiment which
characterises it is considerably sweeter than that of the preceding
Grazioso.
</p><p>
The closing rondo is good and worthy, and accomplished with
Bachian colour and modulation.
</p><p>
The third sonata is most striking and very original; the Allegro
expresses the obstinacy of the composer, and melts into an Andante in
the sentimental style; a true dialogue-piece, which leaves an indelible
mark on one&#8217;s memory. It closes with a lively Scherzando e Presto.
</p><p>
The first part of the fourth sonata is in a style which one rarely
encounters in sonatas, legato throughout, and it brings great deal of
honour to its composer. Like a long earthworm, wriggling to the end, but
 a torment for the fingers with awkward stretches. It expresses
excellently the permanent emotional turmoil gnawing at the bileladen
soul of a man, who cannot rid himself of his melancholy. The Andantino e
 Grazioso, also very fine in its melody and expression, is placed
immediately after the second Cantabile, to which it is similar in
atmosphere. The Minuetto which follows impressed me the least of the
whole collection, although it is far from ordinary.

</p><p>
The Allegro con Brio of the fifth sonata should earn the loudest
applause of music lovers; it has, like the Allegro of the second sonata,
 something flowingly brilliant, and is accompanied by the longest and
most singable Adagio in the collection, in which Herr Zinck has shown
how it is possible to use a harp-bass [Alberti bass] of broken chords
with novelty and manly sweetness. I have the warmest of feelings towards
 the last rondo, a rather mischievous creation, full of the oddest
whims, nonsense and wit; Haydn himself could be proud to have written
it.
</p><p>
Finally the last sonata, about which Herr Zinck talks at length in
his preface, is in his great, characteristic wild style. Everything is
in place here, even the affected harmonic and melodic writing in the
Adagio, which would not in its own right please me as much as one of the
 preceding ones, but in conjunction with the preceding Allegro, and the
despairing Presto e furioso which comes after, does not fail to make the
 most disturbing effect. This Presto gives way at the end to a vocal
piece, the setting of Stolberg&#8217;s song: Kain am Ufer des Meers. The idea
of having an instrumental piece end by bursting forth into a piece of
vocal music has something novel and bold about it, but I doubt that it
will often be realised, also because the lyrical vein through which both
 of these genres flourish is rarely the talent of a single person, and
vocal music and instrumental music with words
must often in reality tread quite different paths, which in truth the
critics who define theory have not yet adequately distinguished from one
 another in their nature and constituent parts. Herr Zinck will forgive
me if I say in all honesty that his setting of Stolberg&#8217;s poem, which as
 an instrumental piece I find well considered and exquisite does not
seem so praiseworthy as a piece of vocal music, in that the lengthening
of the word &#8216;geschlagener&#8217; disturbs the passion of the moment, and the
ending of almost every verse which could have been written for a bass,
in a tenor piece, produces the most unpleasant effect.
</p><p>
It should also be added in praise of these sonatas that they are,
overall, as easy to play as they contain beautiful melodies, an
advantage which cannot be claimed for all works of this type, which in
other respects are worthy of praise. There are very few places which
will cause permanent difficulty for those who are acquainted with Bach&#8217;s
 precepts (Sonata IV, p. 24, 1st system, bb. 1-2, where the little
finger has to jump from E flat to F is difficult to allow according to
Bach&#8217;s rules) and in many doubtful cases Herr Zinck, who himself is a
very strong and expressive player, has included fingering above the
music, according to Bach&#8217;s example. For all that, they are anything but
easy;
they much rather demand and create facility of the hand than assume it.
Indeed, they may be used as the most sparkling practice exercises.
Nothing is more harmful to art, nothing debases the noble author&#8217;s art
to mere breadwinning more than the constant, daily spreading obsession
with being <i>easy</i>, eliminating all difficulties, suffocating any
industriousness of effort, adapting everything for the lame fingers of
unpractised hacks or little women; and I readily admit that I become
angry when I see the word &#8220;easy&#8221; in capital letters above a collection
of keyboard music, or if I am forced to see that an artist, who to his
credit has distinguished himself with something out of the ordinary,
appears at the next fair with an announcement &#8220;that, as the only
criticism of his work was that it was too difficult for the player, he
has the honour, in his new collection which is now available&#8221; &#8211; what
pray? &#8211; &#8220;of serving the public some thin gruel.&#8221; How foul!
May Herr Zinck&#8217;s soul never come under the influence of such men, nor
his honour into their company. May he rather make us the gift of
something new before too long&#8221;.

</p><p>
A full listing of Zinck&#8217;s works for Clavier can be found in Appendix II. The <i>Sechs Clavier-Sonaten</i>
 (1783) were reprinted in the Pro Musica Verlag (Leipzig/Berlin, 1954),
including the very revealing German preface but omitting the equally
instructive fingering that the composer had provided. Since this preface
 has never appeared in a complete English version (although both Cramer,
 and later the <i>Niederrheinische Musik-Zeitung</i> (1858, vol. 32)
considered it important enough to reprint complete in German), it is
included here as Appendix III (together with the author&#8217;s original
footnotes).(52)
</p><p>
This preface, as Cramer noted, is patently <i>not</i> a manifesto of a
romantic tendency before its time; although an &#8220;enlightened artist&#8221;,
Zinck dispels any mystique about the sources of a composer&#8217;s inspiration
 or the pictorial heights to which the initial germ idea can be driven.
Like Haydn, he is bluntly unsentimental about the search for an idea and
 perceptive that the subsequent &#8220;development&#8221; relies largely
on hard work; but he is far from prosaic about the scenes and emotions
that he hopes this &#8220;characteristic&#8221; music can encompass, and believes
(as did several of his contemporaries such as Gerstenberg, Ludwig Tieck
and Augusto Apel) that a literary sub-text will help the listener.
C.P.E. Bach, despite his <i>Sanguineus and Melancholicus</i> sonata,
dissented from this view; in letters to Gerstenberg he discredits the
value of texts and the effectiveness of trying to achieve specific
feelings
in music.(53)
</p><p>
Even viewed simply as local phenomena, the remarks of a Thielo,
the musings of a Zinck, the experiments of a Berlin or Wernicke, the
erudition of a Schulz, and the enterprise of a S&#248;nnischen are
sufficiently distinguished to force a reconsideration of what musical
life in Copenhagen was like during the 18th century; the evidence of
what they acheived suggests that it would be unreasonable not to include
 them in broader discussions of the European musical scene as a whole
during
this fecund period.(54)

<b>Appendix III:</b>
</p><p>
Preface<br>
Sechs Clavier-Sonaten, Hamburg, 1783
</p><p>
It was probably the pantomime that provided the first occasion for composing <i>characteristic instrumental pieces</i>;
 and our habit of indicating the essential character of such pieces by
inserting a short title may well have come to us from France. But it is
enough that we have such pieces and in fact, some of the most splendid
masterpieces of this genre have been created by our own fellow
countrymen. Anyone who knows music from this particular angle will admit
 that, whatever emotional state or level of sensibility a man finds
himself in when he picks up his instrument, he is generally able to
produce melodic and harmonic passages that are appropriate to the
particular
situation and that in such situations it is often possible to create
pieces, perhaps by chance, that have more than a tinge of originality.
In fact, I would almost venture to maintain that even in various
untitled instrumental pieces our finest masters have based their music
on certain feelings that were so strong in themselves that they almost
took on the quality of an action.

</p><p>
Of course, without words, music cannot describe actions. But if a
composer were to provide us with a commentary on his works, would this
not make them more comprehensible to the listener and arouse his
attention even more strongly? If this is indeed the case then why
shouldn&#8217;t a commentary be provided? &#8211; It would be extremely useful.
</p><p>
A group of discerning listeners to whom I played the 6th sonata
of this collection seemed to take an even greater interest in it after I
 had explained to them what I had had in mind when writing these pieces.
 And so this has prompted me to do the same here in a more public
context &#8211; in the hope that all true connoisseurs will be so kind as to
communicate their thoughts on the matter to me and, with some
consideration of my good will, pass judgement on the weaknesses of this
work. This I hope all the more if I may briefly acquaint the gentle
reader with the course of my musical education and further progress,
before going on to say more about the sonatas themselves.
</p><p>
I am grateful to my dear father(55) for giving me practical instruction
on several musical instruments and a certain insight into the problems
of harmony. So then I went to Hamburg,56 a city where everyone, in his
own way, and therefore even a young musician not only finds
encouragement, but also is presented with the opportunity to slake his
thirst for knowledge in all aspects of the art of music. Nonetheless, I
was not very happy as far as composition was concerned. One teacher
assessed my work from the perspective of the wine bottle. Another chose
to take me off to Greece, Lydia and Phrygia, or whatever those
provinces down there are called. It was almost as if a kitchen boy were
being forced to acquaint himself with the history of the migration of
plants from their country of origin before learning how to prepare a
plate of vegetables. A third would demolish everything in one day that
he had so avidly built up the day before. Thus it was that I failed to
progress in any way until, finally, assisted by my present, less frantic
 life-style, though not without unspeakable effort on my part, I
consulted what one might call the &#8220;silent&#8221; teachers.(57) May these
sonatas
therefore be seen as an attempt to put into practice all the knowledge that I have collected and assimilated up to now.

</p><p>
These pieces were conceived as follows: In each case the first basic material [<i>Urstoff</i>]
 was stimulated by a particular mood, whether tender, heated,
ill-tempered, happy or whatever. Overcome by one of these moods I then
crept, danced or thundered across the keyboard of my <i>Clavier</i> (58)
 in the manner dictated to me by the feeling predominant at the time.
The notes produced in this way corresponded approximately
to the theme that was then developed further as and when
the opportunity and time arose. Thus, the Andante of the third sonata
came about after I overheard a dialogue between Madame la Capricieuse
and her mild-mannered husband. The last sonata has the following
history: I was angry about something (I no longer remember what), in
fact I was extremely angry and annoyed and so I sat down at my <i>Clavier</i> in order to vent my feelings on it and rattled off the following:

<img class="imgleft whiteborder" src="upload/MusEx13.jpg"><br clear="all">

</p><p>
At this point I stopped, and the similarity between the beginning of
this passage and the music I had written for Count von Stolberg&#8217;s <i>Cain on the Seashore</i>
 several months previously suddenly brought that whole ghastly story of
fratricide to mind. I could see Cain staring at the blood gushing from
his murdered brother&#8217;s wound, then fleeing, and stopping again, turning
and shuddering violently at the sight of his brother in the throes of
death. I envisaged him sighing loudly as
he raised his eyes to heaven, still partly in anger but also partly
filled with regret, before stamping his foot on the ground, running
away, stopping again and stamping his foot and then running off again &#8211; I
 saw how he fell, wringing his hands with his face bent towards the
ground, how he tried to pray but could not, stammering out little more
than syllables in a way that betrayed the fear in his heart that had
been sparked by the judge within him &#8211; how, after a short terrible
pause, he flew wildly through the wilderness like a hurricane, with
streaming hair and rolling eyes in complete desperation. At each winged
step he was accompanied by terrible tormenting visions of
the Furies, the pale figure of his murdered brother or his bleeding
wound, with the accursed club dotted with hair and blood hovering in
front of him, until finally he reached the precipitous cliffs on the
shore of the ocean and wailed at the waves: &#8216;Woe, woe is me ! Where have
 my battered senses been taking me?&#8221;

</p><p>
It remains to be asked whether, and if so, in what way such ideas can be
 executed in a keyboard piece, and indeed have actually been executed
here; also whether these sonatas do actually contain the occasional
characteristic feature that I feel I managed to include in them. That is
 indeed the question! And a lenient judgement on this work will give me
an indication as to what extent I can continue working in this
direction.
</p><p>
Finally, my thoughts still often turn to a number of discerning
listeners and friends of music on the banks of the Saale, the Elbe, the
Spree and the Havel, etc. with whom I was fortunate enough to become
closely acquainted by playing some of these sonatas to them, and whose
friendly advice has been extremely helpful. To them, therefore, I should
 like to express my everlasting appreciation, as indeed I should to my
subscribers and players.

Studerende er Musiken n&#230;sten lige saa n&#248;dvendig, som B&#248;ger; naar Hiernen
 og Sindet af studeringer er udmattede, da blive de
igjen ved Musik forfrisket, naar man i steden for Bogen kand tage fat og
 tractere et eller andet Instrument, hvilket 0opv&#230;kker hos de Studerende
 en munter Geist, og igien opmuntrer ham til
at l&#230;se.</i>

</p><p>
20. En Komponist maa have l&#230;rt Videnskaber, see til Graun, Scheibe,
H&#230;ndel &amp; Heinchen, han maa v&#230;re en god Orator. En musikalisk
Componist maa i sine stykkeropv&#230;kke Affecten
saavel som en Orator. Nu hertil er Regler forn&#248;den: hvor har du l&#230;rt
dem? Du har jo ikke haft Lejlig at anvende dine unge Aarpaa saadanne
Studie. L&#230;s den kongelige Kapelmesters Scheibens
Critische Musicum, denne l&#230;rde Mands Veltalenhed kand bedre og tydeligere overbeviise dig Tingen.

21. <i>Naar nu den Lejlighed gives i et Compagnie, at en Mester lader
sig h&#248;re paa et Musikalisk Instrument, lader det s&#230;r abgesmagt, naar
Tilh&#248;rerne formedelst Discourser eller anden saadan Omst&#230;ndighed, kommer
 nogens St&#248;yen af sted; this saasnart man gj&#248;r det ringeste, som er
Stilhed imod, enten ve at gaae frem og tilbage, ved at sankke,
un&#248;dvendig Hosten, urigtig
Taktslagen, saa taber enhver Mester Lyst til at spille, og bliver i det,
 han ellers f&#230;rdig kunde, fouroliget, i Phantasien forhindret, og hans
Indfald flyder da ikke.</i>

22. In Thielo&#8217;s novel <i>Charlotte eller forunderlige Tildragelser med Fr&#248;ken von Weisens&#248;e</i>, 1757-1758 (in German as <i>Charlotte die Geschichte der Fr&#228;ulein von Weissensee</i>,
 1758), the music master recommends that children should learn music
from an early age, maybe six or seven years old &#8220;although many parents
feel they should learn to dance first&#8221;. He recommends that every
keyboard player &#8220;should have two trills in each hand&#8221;, and reminds his
readers that only good clavichords can produce <i>Bebung</i>. Music should not
appear to be difficult and for that reason he does not recommend
crossing hands, &#8220;which is especially unsuitable for ladies wearing
corsets or bracelets&#8221;. Quoted in Carl Thrane: <i>Fra Klavikordiets Tid</i>, 1898.

</p><p>
23. In the index to the volume, Thielo defines <i>Tremuletto</i> as &#8220;a vibrato on the clavier when you keep the fingers on the keys and flex the strings&#8221;.

seyn, so wird er sich ein rauhes und hartes Spielen angew&#246;hnen".

55. Bendix Friedrich Zinck. At the present time he is the organist of
the cathedral church in Schleswig. A number of years ago he published
his <i>Short Duets for Various Instruments, but Especially for Two Flutes</i>,
 which are extremely helpful for flautists at the elementary and
intermediate levels, not least because of the enclosed fingering tables
and examples &#8211; though of course this assumes that they are studied with
the same degree of diligence as that with which they were put together.
And the small number of the keys on the flute means that they can also
preserve a good musical ear relatively undamaged because a player&#8217;s
hearing is not simply made pure even if
those keys manage to communicate the beauty and evenness of the notes.

</p><p>
56. I think back with pleasure to the good things that I saw, heard and
enjoyed inthe course of my ten-year stay there: all the fine oratorios
by the best composers that I heard, played or sang in in the amateur and
 public concertos, the German, French and Italian operettas, pantomimes
and ballets that I saw being performed in the theatres, the large
numbers of foreign musicians performing either in public or for private
gatherings, the high standard of much of the church music, the small but
intensely competitive musical circles, and, finally, the <i>generous patrons</i>, friends of music and philanthropists who helped increase my happiness. However, of these many I
should like to express my most heartfelt gratitude to a man and
philanthropist who dedicated his special affection to me, namely the
great master of our art, Capellmeister C.P.E. Bach. And now my thoughts
turn to you my dear friends &#8211; that is, to all of
those with whom by age or shared convictions I have been closely associated and in whose company hours seemed like minutes.

</p><p>
57.  Mr C.P.E. Bach&#8217;s <i>Essay on the True Art of Playing Keyboard Instruments</i>, Kirnberger&#8217;s <i>Art of Pure Composition</i>
 and Marpurg&#8217;s theoretical writings succeeded in making me secure in the
 rules of the art, whilst the practical works of the finest classical
masters served as models for imitation.

</p><p>
58. Although fate would have it that I was obliged to practise the flute more than anything else it is the <i>Clavier</i> that is incomparably closer to my heart.</p>
