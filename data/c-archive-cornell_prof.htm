The
 Program for Andrew D. White Professors-at-Large was established in 
celebration of Cornell's first centenary, and named in honour of its 
first President, with whom the idea originated. President White 
expressed concern lest Cornell's first faculty, "remote from great 
cities and centres of thought and action...lose connection with the 
world at large, save through books...'bred in and in' and become 
provincial in spirit." To help insure this would not happen, he proposed
 "the establishment of a system of non-resident professors," selected 
for their distinguished achievements in diverse disciplines and walks of
 life, who would visit the University periodically over extended periods
 of time. Under such a system, "the resident professors would be thrown 
into close relations at once with the special professors. Their views 
would be enlarged, their efforts stimulated, their whole life 
quickened."

&#8220;Cornell University's Andrew Dickson White Professors-at-Large Program 
has been called one of the truly imaginative projects in American 
universities, bringing a steady stream of the world's foremost scholars,
 thinkers, and artists to the Cornell campus. Being named an Andrew 
Dickson White Professor-at-Large ranks among an academic's most eminent 
distinctions and honors.&#8220;
