On 27 April, Christopher travelled from New York (where he was attending
and supporting the AAM concert at Carnegie Hall) to Switzerland to
receive an honorary doctorate from the University of Z&#252;rich. This
doctorate, recognising Christopher&#8217;s work in the field of performance
practice and musicology both reflects and extends his commitment to
Swiss musical life; Christopher has worked for many years with Tonhalle
Orchestra Z&#252;rich, Kammerorchester Basel and the Paul Sacher Foundation
and returned to conduct performances of Schumann&#8217;s Manfred with Tonhalle
 for the Z&#252;rich Festspiele in June this year.</p>
