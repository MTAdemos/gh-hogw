<img src="upload/fasch-vol-3.jpg" alt="fasch-vol-3.jpg" class="imgleft" height="331" width="234">The
 third and final volume of keyboard music from the reclusive Carl Fasch 
contains his four sets of extended keyboard variations, including some 
impressive displays of virtuosity, and a variety of short keyboard 
works, the majority of them previously unpublished.

</p><p>
This volume completes the survey of his Complete Keyboard Works, which 
justify contemporary opinion that he was the true successor to C. P. E. 
Bach, and for the first time provides the modern player with remarkable 
new repertoire for performance on the clavichord, harpsichord, or 
fortepiano.
