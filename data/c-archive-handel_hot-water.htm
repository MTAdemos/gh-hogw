Reveal&#8217;d&#8217;, a forthcoming exhibition at Handel House Museum (April 
8&#8212;October 25, 2009). Christopher, already a biographer, editor and

It
 will be a key part of the programme marking the 250th anniversary of 
the death of the composer, which, Christopher says, &#8216;gives us the 
opportunity of presenting &#8216;Handel the man&#8217;, something which is rarely 
done. It is a true delight to be able to do so in the very rooms in 
which Handel lived and created the music that brought him international 
fame. The House is imbued with the atmosphere of Georgian London 
society, in which Handel was a commanding presence.&#8217;

&#8216;A series of concerts and exhibitions is planned to mark the 250th 
anniversary of Handel&#8217;s death on April 14, 1759. The conductor and 
musicologist Christopher Hogwood is curating an exhibition &#8216;Handel 
Reveal&#8217;d&#8217; (April 8&#8212;October 25) at the Handel House Museum in Brook 
Street, London W1, where the composer lived. It will focus on his social
 and financial life, his Old Master collection, his enthusiasm for 
food&#8212;he was annoyed to be cariacatured as the &#8216;Harmonius Boar&#8217; by 
Goupy&#8212;and his health, including his medical treatment for strokes, 
palsy, gout and blindness. Mr Hogwood explains: &#8216;My dilemma as to how to
 do the exhibition was solved while lecturing at a prep school. A 
10-year-old boy asked &#8220;Can you tell me if Handel had a hot-water 
bottle?&#8221;. He insisted it was an important detail, and that started my 
train of thought about what we don&#8217;t know about Handel. He was a 
careful, private person.&#8217;

&#8216;The Foundling Museum in Brunswick Square, London, has an exhibition, 
&#8216;Handel the Philanthropist&#8217;, from January to June, focusing on his 
charitable life, and Radio 3 will broadcast a Handel opera every Tuesday
 afternoon. On March 1, the world premiere of a new oratorio, 25 Brook 
Street, will take place at St George&#8217;s Hanover Square. For details,
