This month sees the DVD release of Christopher's Royal Opera House production of <i>Dido and Aeneas</i>. 
Filmed live during performances in April, the DVD captures &#8220;an evening of exquisite sensual pleasure&#8221; (<i>The Telegraph</i>) 
and includes an interview with director and choreographer Wayne McGregor.

&#8220;Christopher Hogwood rises to the challenge of this poignantly sombre 
production by drawing superbly expressive playing from the OAE and 
equally fine singing from the Royal Opera Extra Chorus&#8221;, wrote <i>The Times</i>.

The production is notable also for the ROH debut of Sarah Connolly, a &#8220;classically tragic Dido&#8221; (<i>Financial Times</i>), who led the following cast:

&#8220;Musically, Christopher Hogwood leads the Orchestra of the Age of 
Enlightenment with spring and energy, although he is highly sensitive in
 the introspective, tender, and tragic moments. His continuo 
section&#8212;harpsichord, theorbo, cello, and chamber organ&#8212;is impressive, 
and he can get a true rumble out of the whole band very effectively (the
 music before the Witches' Dance truly growls). His is not a dainty 
performance&#8212;there is plenty of vibrato from singers and players 
alike&#8212;and orchestra and chorus are as remarkably expressive as they are
 musically solid and certain.&#8221; (<i>ClassicsToday.Com</i>, Robert Levine)

Purcell's opera formed one half of &#8220;a magnificent double-bill&#8221; (<i>The Telegraph</i>) completed by Handel's <i>Acis and Galatea</i>, which is itself due for release on
DVD in March 2010.
