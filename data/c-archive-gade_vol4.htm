Niels Wilhelm Gade&#8217;s series of eight symphonies established an 
influential pattern for subsequent generations of Scandinavian 
composers, blending essentially classical form and Romantic expression, 
in the tradition of Spohr, Mendelssohn and Schumann, but adding to the 
mix a hint of Nordic folk music. The most radical of the series in many 
respects is his <b>Symphony No.1 in C minor Op.5</b>, composed in the spring and summer of 1842, when he was twenty-five. He intended it to build on the success of his overture <i>Echoes of Ossian</i>
 in a concert of the Copenhagen Musical Society the previous year. But 
when he submitted the new work to the Society in August 1842, it failed 
to win approval. Instead, he offered it to the Leipzig Gewandhaus 
Orchestra, where it attracted the attention of the orchestra&#8217;s director 
Felix Mendelssohn. After rehearsing the Symphony, Mendelssohn wrote 
effusively to Gade, saying that &#8216;not for a long time has any piece 
struck me as more lively or more beautiful&#8217;; and after the first 
performance in March 1843, he reported that it had aroused &#8216;the lively, 
undivided joy of the whole audience, which broke into the loudest 
applause after each of the four movements&#8217;. Gade travelled to Leipzig 
later that year, and in October himself conducted a second performance 
of the Symphony, with similar success. This led to an invitation to him 
to become assistant conductor of the Gewandhaus Orchestra, and for a 
short period after Mendelssohn&#8217;s death in 1847 chief conductor.
</p><p>
In a recent study, <i>The early works of Niels W. Gade: in search of the poetic</i>,
 the American scholar Anna Harwell Celenza has traced the origins of the
 First Symphony to an entry in a composition diary kept by Gade 
outlining the programme of a symphony &#8216;based on battle-text songs&#8217;, with
 only a few annotations of key and scoring, but with several quotations 
from the texts of Danish folk ballads. When Gade came to write the work,
 he apparently discarded several of these references; but he added a 
musical quotation, of his own 1840 setting of a ballad text by his older
 contemporary B. S. Ingemann, entitled <i>Kong Valdemars Jagt</i> (&#8216;King
 Waldemar&#8217;s Hunt&#8217;), and beginning &#8216;Paa Sj&#248;lands fagre Sletter&#8217; (&#8216;On 
Zealand&#8217;s fair plains&#8217;). Gade&#8217;s song is heard in the slow introduction 
to the first movement of the symphony, and recurs later in the movement 
in different versions; it also returns in the finale. In addition, many 
of the other principal ideas of the symphony may well be derived, 
consciously or unconsciously, from its simple opening phrase, its later 
descending scale, its suggestions of hunting horns in the accompaniment,
 or its shifts between the minor key and its relative major. With 
hindsight, this intensive use of a song with folk-like characteristics 
on a Danish subject has been seen as giving the work a nationalist 
flavour. But Celenza argues that such a view is &#8216;the consequence of 
nineteenth-century German criticism and twentieth-century scholarship&#8217;, 
and has little or nothing to do with Gade&#8217;s intentions or how the 
symphony was perceived at the time; she even points out that the reason 
given by the Copenhagen Musical Society for turning down the work was 
that it was &#8216;too German&#8217;.
</p><p>
Ingemann&#8217;s poem &#8216;King Waldemar&#8217;s Hunt&#8217; &#8212; derived from the legends which 
formed the basis for Schoenberg&#8217;s Gurrelieder and C&#233;sar Franck&#8217;s 
tone-poem <i>Le chasseur maudit</i> &#8212; relates how, as a punishment for 
blasphemy, King Waldemar is condemned after his death to ride every 
night with his followers on a wild hunt. The slow introduction to the 
first movement sets the peaceful scene described in the first stanza of 
the poem, with Gade&#8217;s song melody accompanied by quiet horn calls; then 
in the main <i>Allegro energico</i> the wild hunt begins. After the 
forceful first subject, which gains in impetus from its use of a dotted 
rhythm not as an upbeat figure but on strong downbeats, the song theme 
provides all the subsidiary material &#8212; notably a second subject of 
repeated horn fanfares, sounding first distant and then close at hand. 
Most unusually, the whole of the central development section reverts to 
the 6/4 time of the introduction and its mood of suspenseful calm. After
 a recapitulation which is a much altered version of the exposition, the
 movement has a coda based once more on the song theme, and ending in a 
triumphant C major.
</p><p>
Celenza relates the Scherzo of the symphony to the Danish folk ballad <i>Elverskud</i>,
 of which several lines are quoted in Gade&#8217;s composition diary (and 
which he was to use in 1853 as the basis for a large-scale cantata). The
 ballad describes a confrontation between Herr Olaf, riding into the 
countryside before his wedding, and the Elf-King&#8217;s daughter, who tries 
to attract him into her fairy world; when Olaf resists, she utters a 
curse on him, and he falls ill and dies, to be reunited with his bride 
only after her death from a broken heart. This programme would certainly
 explain the unusual construction of the movement, which, rather than 
having a conventional scherzo-and-trio outline, alternates between 
episodes in C major, with recurring crescendos in galloping rhythms 
suggesting Herr Olaf&#8217;s ride, and slower interludes in A minor, with 
muted violins over held chords conjuring up a fairy atmosphere. Each 
section is freely developed rather than repeated literally, with the 
third and final A minor interlude sadly recalling a theme from the C 
major sections, and the last C major section ending explosively.
</p><p>
This Scherzo is scored without the piccolo, trumpets, timpani and tuba 
of the outer movements of the symphony, but retains their quartet of 
horns and trio of trombones. The lyrical F major slow movement 
additionally drops the trombones, deploying the remaining instruments in
 Gade&#8217;s habitual changing mixtures of wind and string tone. Although no 
literary basis has been firmly identified for this movement, it does 
have a hint of narrative in its free alternation of its various themes, 
including a solemn horn melody, within an overall plan of two 
asymmetrical halves with extra rondo-like returns of the expressive 
first theme. In the C major finale, the exuberant opening idea is 
complemented by a solemn wind chorale, and by a folk-like melody 
accompanied by pizzicato strings, recalling the &#8216;bardic&#8217; harp of <i>Echoes of Ossian</i>.
 These themes are combined in the largely contrapuntal development 
section with the song melody from the first movement; and the same 
melody recurs in the coda in a starkly simplified form, before being 
finally reduced to a succession of blazing fanfares.
</p><p>
Gade wrote his <b>Symphony No.5 in D minor Op.25</b> ten years after 
No.1, in 1852 &#8212; by which time he had returned from Leipzig to 
Copenhagen, taken over the direction of the Musical Society, and 
established himself as a leading figure in Danish musical life. He 
conducted the first performance of the work at a Musical Society concert
 in December 1852. It was composed as a surprise wedding present to his 
wife Sophie, the daughter of his colleague J. P. E. Hartmann, whom he 
had married that April (and who was to die in childbirth in 1855). The 
surprise lay in the fact that it included an important piano part in all
 four movements. This was the first such keyboard obbligato in any 
symphony: but earlier the same year Gade had composed a <i>Spring Fantasia</i> for voices and orchestra which placed the piano in a similar role; and he may have found a model in Henry Litolff&#8217;s series of <i>Concertos symphoniques</i>
 for piano and orchestra, which had begun in the1840s. Gade&#8217;s piano 
part, reminiscent of Mendelssohn&#8217;s chamber music in the fluency of its 
figuration, is neither a concertante solo part, nor simply an 
intermittent accompaniment, but is as it were inlaid into the texture. 
Because such an effect is difficult to achieve on a modern concert grand
 piano, this recording uses a much lighter instrument made by Erard of 
Paris in 1837, with the orchestral strings reduced in numbers for the 
sake of balance.
</p><p>
Despite the happy circumstances in which it was composed, the Symphony 
begins (like No.1 and no fewer than three of Gade&#8217;s other symphonies) 
with a movement in the minor mode. Dramatic orchestral passages in 
dotted and double-dotted rhythms alternate with the two main themes, the
 first an expressive eight-bar idea accompanied by piano arpeggios, the 
second a major-key melody shared by the piano and the orchestra, with 
ingenious doublings, which is expanded to considerable length. After a 
repeat of this exposition section, the development is concerned less 
with discussion of themes than with movement through different keys and a
 gradual build-up in the weight of the piano figuration. In the 
recapitulation, the second theme first of all returns in D minor, but 
then shifts into the major; and the coda is also in D major, bringing 
back the first subject at half speed, and ending in tranquillity.
</p><p>
Of the two middle movements, the slow movement this time comes first. It
 is in the unexpected key of F sharp major, and in a gentle 9/8 time, 
with muted violins. The piano is silent throughout the calm first 
section, but joins in for the more dramatic middle section, and remains 
part of the texture, with continuous tremolandos and trills, in the much
 varied reprise of the opening. The Scherzo, too, favours variation over
 literal repeats, alternating in a continuous, developing sequence 
between three main sections in B flat major and two trios respectively 
in G flat major (a respelling of the slow movement&#8217;s F sharp) and E flat
 major. The piano writing here is at its most scintillating.
</p><p>
The D major finale, which adds piccolo and three trombones to the 
orchestral forces, begins with a slow introduction which, with its 
sustained horn note and solemn rolled piano chords, momentarily suggests
 a hidden programme similar to those underlying parts at least of the 
First Symphony. But the atmosphere of this introduction is dispelled in 
the ebullient main Allegro, with its first theme based on arpeggio 
figures and its second on graceful melodic curves; and although a few 
shadows pass across the development section, the work ends in a mood of 
joyful celebration.
