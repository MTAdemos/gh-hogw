Sonata Grande in G minor, Op.39<br>
HH186<br></b>
</p><p>
Christopher's latest edition to be published by Edition HH is now available.
</p><p>
The Sonata in G minor, Op. 39 was Eberl&#8217;s last composition; A. Duane 
White described it as  &#8220;his most outstanding work for piano solo&#8221;, and 
&#8220;a significant forerunner of the Romantic era&#8221; (<i>New Grove</i>). Its 
formal innovations include a slow movement in the remote key of E major 
(with hints of Field and Chopin as well as Beethoven&#8217;s &#8220;Waldstein&#8221; 
Sonata), which also makes a &#8220;cyclic&#8221; return in the course of the finale,
 and the use of a single motive (a rising sixth and falling second first
 heard in the opening bars), which unifies all three movements.
