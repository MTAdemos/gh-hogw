With the publication of Volume III of the Complete 
Works for Keyboard by H.O.C. Zinck (1746-1832), Christopher rounds off a
 project which was been received with enthusiasm in the press:

    <p>
<i>&#8220;... powerfully original, it is to be hoped that these sonatas will 
quickly find a place in the repertoires of all serious players and will 
take their rightful place in concerts.&#8221;</i> <br>
(Clavichord International)

<img src="upload/hh242_zinckvol-iii.jpg" alt="hh242_zinckvol-iii.jpg" class="imgleft" height="424" width="300">The final instalment of the three-volume collection of Zinck&#8217;s complete keyboard music (<a href="http://www.editionhh.co.uk/hh242cat.htm" class="bluelink">Edition HH 242</a>) contains his sets of variations (one on the tune made popular by Mozart, <i>&#8220;Lison dormait&#8221;</i>,
 and the other a surprisingly virtuoso set on a simple children&#8216;s song) 
and a sequence of his very individual miscellaneous pieces, including 
the atmospheric setting for keyboard solo of <i>&#8220;Das Traumschiff&#8221;</i> 
(complete with nautical illustration). Many of his teaching pieces are 
published here for the first time from a manuscript source in the Royal 
Library, Copenhagen, and include original fingering from the composer. 
</p><p>
Volume I (<a href="http://www.editionhh.co.uk/hh240cat.htm" class="bluelink">Edition HH 240</a>) contains Zinck&#8217;s Six Sonatas (1783), and
the recent publication of Volume II (<a href="http://www.editionhh.co.uk/hh241cat.htm" class="bluelink">Edition HH
241</a>) completed the sonata collection, including the first appearance in
print of two sonatas (XI and XII).

</p><p>
Zinck had studied with C. P. E. Bach in Hamburg, and the influence of <i>Empfindsamkeit</i>
 is very apparent in his works. But there are later and interesting 
changes as he evolved a more Italianate keyboard manner, and also 
incorporated elements of the folk and popular music encountered during 
his residence in Denmark. 
</p><p>
Zinck followed C. P. E. Bach in promoting the use of the clavichord, but
 his music is equally successful on the fortepiano, and would provide a 
welcome novelty today both for recital programming and in teaching.</p>

The series has already attracted much attention from musicians grateful 
for the opportunity to appraise and enjoy this rarely performed 
composer&#8217;s works, presented here in a scholarly edition for the first 
time.  
<p>
<i>&#8220;Edition HH should be applauded for their willingness to seek out 
rare but wholly worthwhile repertoire, and their knack of bringing it to
 our attention through 
extremely high quality and usable editions.</i>  (The Consort)</p><p></p>
