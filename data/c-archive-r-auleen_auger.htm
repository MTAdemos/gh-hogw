Arleen Auger&#8217;s all-Haydn recital, mixing the familiar (<i>Arianna a Naxos</i> &#8212; performed here in an 18th-century arrangement for string orchestra &#8212; and the great <i>Scena di Berenice)</i>
 and a clutch of rarities, rightly won plaudits on its original release 
in 1990. With her limpid, gently rounded tone, immaculate coloratura and
 unfailing elegance of phrase, Auger had few rivals in this repertoire. 
Other singers, including Bernarda Fink (on a new Harmonia Mundi disc, 
reviewed last issue), have brought more anguished abandon to the 
soliloquy of the bereft Berenice. Auger&#8217;s classical princesses, here and
 in <i>Arianna</i>, retain a certain stoical dignity. But this is not to
 imply her singing is remotely chilly. While never compromising beauty 
and purity of line, she conjures plenty of passion for the heroines&#8217; 
final outbursts, where her depth and incisiveness of tone may surprise 
the unwary.
</p><p>
If the cantata <i>Miseri noi</i> sounds too serene and (in the final 
section) chirpy for its grim text, the fault is Haydn&#8217;s. Auger&#8217;s singing
 is, as ever, a model of musicality and grace. She is just as delightful
 in the touching Petrarch setting Solo e pensoso and perky <i>buffa</i> 
aria bemoaning men&#8217;s faithlessness. Hogwood and his Boston period band 
provide neat and spirited accompaniments. A moving reminder of a supreme
 Classical stylist who, like her exact contemporary Lucia Popp, died far
 too young.

<b>CD sleeve notes</b>
</p><p>
During his long career as operatic Kapellmeister for Prince Nicolaus 
Esterh&#225;zy in Hungary, Haydn performed many popular operas of the day in 
the princely theatre at Esterh&#225;za (which seated 500 and was free to any 
decently dressed man or woman). Sometimes Haydn took considerable 
liberties with the scores, fleshing out the often rather simple 
orchestration of the Italian arias by adding wind instruments or 
shortening pieces he thought too lengthy or verbose. Occasionally he 
replaced an entire aria with one of his own composition, and this was 
particularly true if Haydn&#8217;s pretty, olive-skinned Italian mistress, 
Luigia Polzelli, participated. She was a soubrette of limited talents, 
but Haydn loved her tenderly and wrote music obviously calculated to 
bring out all her best qualities. The music he composed for her makes 
her sound like a great flirt.
</p><p>
Usually we have libretti printed for the occasion with cast lists, but in the case of the <i>pasticcio</i> entitled <i>La Circe, ossia L&#8217;isola incantata</i> based on two operas, one, <i>La maga Circe</i>, by Pasquale Anfossi and the other, <i>Ipocondriaco</i>,
 by Gottlieb Naumann, which Haydn conducted at Esterh&#225;za in 1789, we are
 unable to say whether Luigia sang the part of Lindora, who receives a 
whole new aria by Haydn entitled &#8220;Son pietosa, son bonina&#8221;. This pretty 
two-part work is one of at least three large-scale insertions which 
Haydn composed for this <i>pasticcio</i>.
</p><p>
We have no information when or for what occasion Haydn wrote his cantata <i>Miseri noi, misera patria</i>
 except that it was before 1786 (when Haydn&#8217;s Viennese publisher sold a 
copy in manuscript to Germany). It is probably the work Haydn sent to 
the impresario J. P. Salomon in London in 1790 to be sung by Nancy 
Storace (Mozart&#8217;s first Susanna in <i>Le nozze di Figaro</i>). Only 
discovered and published after World War II, this beautiful cantata 
describes the destruction of a city by pillaging troops.
</p><p>
On the other hand, the famous <i>Scena di Berenice</i> was especially 
composed in London for the celebrated dramatic soprano Brigida Banti. 
Haydn gave it at his benefit concert in May 1795 in the King&#8217;s Theatre. 
Afterwards he noted in his diary that &#8220;she sang very scanty&#8221;. Banti must
 have had an off night, because otherwise she was the toast of the town 
and had London at her feet. This scene &#8212; a dramatic evocation of a 
loving woman abandoned by her partner &#8212; is Haydn&#8217;s greatest and most 
profound contribution to the form, ending in a fiercely expressed aria 
in F minor.
</p><p>
The composer&#8217;s last concert aria, &#8220;Solo e pensoso&#8221;, was composed in 
1798, the year of The Creation&#8217;s first performance. This pensive setting
 of a Petrarch sonnet was given its first hearing at a pre-Christmas 
pair of concerts of the Society of Musicians in Vienna, when it was sung
 by the mezzo-soprano Antonie Flamm, with whom Haydn had earlier 
collaborated in the vocal version of the oratorio <i>The Seven Last Words of the Saviour on the Cross.</i>
</p><p>
The way in which these pieces have survived is often rather curious. 
When Haydn left Hungary to visit London in 1790, he took with him a 
collection of these arias, removing the scores physically from the 
operas to which they had been attached. Hence in the score of <i>La Circe</i>
 from the Esterh&#225;zy Archives in Budapest, the aria &#8220;Son pietosa&#8221; is 
missing, but from the set of manuscript parts one double bass shows 
where it ought to go. Haydn gave one copy of the aria to a friend in 
England; and another ended up in G&#246;ttweig Abbey in Austria; a third was 
given to a visiting Swedish diplomat in Vienna and is now in a Swedish 
castle. The first edition was not issued until the 1950s.
</p><p>
In the case of the cantata <i>Miseri noi, misera patria</i>, the only 
two manuscripts in the world &#8212; one authentic with corrections and 
additions by Haydn but not complete, the other complete &#8212; are in the 
Library of Congress in Washington. The first performance of the work 
took place during a Haydn series which the BBC produced in 1958; 
subsequently the cantata was published for the first time in 1960.
</p><p>
The great <i>Scena di Berenice</i> has survived in Haydn&#8217;s autograph 
manuscript (in the Vienna Stadtbibliothek) but was not printed until the
 1930s. Since then, a new manuscript which Haydn gave to a visiting 
English singer in Vienna in 1797, has come to light; it is important 
because it restores the cut of three bars at the beginning which Haydn 
made post 1797 in the autograph manuscript. (The cut means simply that 
the <i>Scena</i> begins <i>forte</i> rather than <i>piano</i>, but the opening material which Haydn removed is thematically related to what follows, and is included in this recording.)
</p><p>
The setting of the Petrarch sonnet &#8220;Solo e pensoso&#8221; has survived only in
 Haydn&#8217;s autograph manuscript (in the Paris Biblioth&#232;que Nationale); it 
too was not printed until 1961. It features two clarinet parts (also 
present in the <i>Scena di Berenice</i> where, however, they are more reticent) which again reminds us of the proximity to <i>The Creation</i>
 with its involved use of clarinets, instruments which Haydn had only 
occasionally used in his orchestra at Esterh&#225;za. He inherited in the 
Vienna orchestra the clarinet players for whom Mozart had written his 
famous wind band music, which had changed the whole concept of 
orchestration and especially wind writing.
</p><p>
<i>Arianna a Naxos</i>, the most puzzling of Haydn&#8217;s cantatas, was first
 sung by the Italian castrato Pacchierotti during his last visit to 
England in 1791 with Haydn accompanying him on the fortepiano. The press
 declared the piece &#8220;so exquisitely captivating in its larmoyant 
passages, that it touched and dissolved the audience... Pacchierotti 
never, in his most brilliant age, was more successful&#8221;. The work was 
repeated a few days later at the Pantheon, in a programme that also 
included a Haydn symphony played by an orchestra of 300. Although 
Haydn&#8217;s published version is for keyboard and voice, the work is 
instrumental in concept, and a recently discovered letter from the 
composer to the music publisher John Bland says: &#8220; The cantata <i>Ariana auf Naxos</i>
 I intend later on to orchestrate for a full band&#8221;. It seems that Haydn 
never managed to make this orchestration, and it was not until the next 
century that an anonymous version for full orchestra (transposed to F) 
was published in Vienna.
</p><p>
More interesting, however, is a scoring for strings from the Martorell 
Collection in the Library of Congress &#8212; the same volume that provides 
the material for <i>Miseri noi, misera patria</i>. Much of this 
collection appears to be connected with direct Haydn sources (via the 
King of Naples) and, although the arrangement is anonymous, there are 
many elaborations and recompositions which make it more than a simple 
transcription; the implicit canonic imitations in the introduction, for 
instance, are given in full, and in later recitative sections we find 
additional tempo indications, and a filling out of the textures implied 
in the keyboard version. It is also specifically for string orchestra 
and not simply string quartet (as is the version in Zittau made by F. W.
 Hildebrand) since the score distinguishes between full <i>bassi</i> and a line for <i>violoncello</i>. Clearly the arranger was more than a mere hack, and even without Haydn&#8217;s <i>imprimatur</i>,
 an authentic 18th-century orchestral version of this unique cantata is 
an important addition to the repertoire. For this recording the cantata 
has been newly edited; vocal embellishments and cadenzas have been based
 on suggestions in the Viennese orchestral version, as well as variants 
contained in the Library of Congress score.

<b>Performers&#8217; biographies</b>
</p><p>
The ravishing angelic voice of <b>Arleen Auger</b> was stilled on 10 
June 1993, when she succumbed to brain cancer, aged 53. As winner of the
 1967 Viktor Fuchs Vocal Competition she went to Vienna, was soon 
&#8220;discovered&#8221; and immediately signed by the Vienna Staatsoper and made 
her debut there as the Queen of the Night with Josef Krips conducting. 
In 1969, she made acclaimed debuts with the New York City Opera (Queen 
of the Night) and the Metropolitan Opera (Marzelline) with Karl B&#246;hm.
</p><p>
During her illustrious career she was a welcome and familiar figure in 
the world&#8217;s most prestigious concert halls and opera houses including La
 Scala, the Metropolitan, Vienna&#8217;s Staatsoper, Carnegie Hall, Avery 
Fisher Hall, Le Ch&#226;telet, the Concertgebouw, Wigmore Hall and Royal 
Festival Hall. She also appeared at over sixty major music festivals and
 made thirteen recital tours worldwide. In 1986 she was the first 
American to sing at a British Royal Wedding, when she sang Mozart&#8217;s <i>Exsultate, jubilate</i> to a television audience of over 700 million.
</p><p>
Her discography of over 300 recordings ranges from Bach to Schoenberg 
and she has been honoured with countless awards including the Orph&#233;e 
d&#8217;Or, Deutscher Schallplattenpreis, Grand Prix du Disque, multiple 
Edison Prizes and a posthumous Grammy.
</p><p>
Since founding The Academy of Ancient Music in 1973, <b>Christopher Hogwood</b>
 has gained international recognition for his performances of baroque 
and early classical repertoire with period instruments. But for more 
than forty years he has also been performing music of the twentieth 
century, with a particular affinity for the neo-baroque and 
neo-classical schools including many works by Stravinsky, Martinu and 
&#8216;Entartete&#8217; composers. As a musicologist he is currently involved in 
editing works ranging from Purcell and Handel via Mendelssohn to Elgar 
and Martinu.
</p><p>
He has a celebrated catalogue of more than 200 recordings with The 
Academy of Ancient Music, and his recent recording projects range from 
the symphonies and overtures of Niels Gade to &#8216;The Secret Bach&#8217;, the 
first in a series of baroque and classical music for clavichord. The 
neo-classical is also represented in an ongoing series of recordings 
with the Kammerorchester Basel, which includes works by Martinu, 
Stravinsky, Honegger and Britten.
</p><p>
In addition to his position as Director of The AAM, he continues as 
Principal Guest Conductor of the Orchestra Sinfonica di Milano Giuseppe 
Verdi and the Kammerorchester Basel; he is also Conductor Laureate of 
the Handel and Haydn Society with whom he has been working for more than
 twenty years.
</p><p>
Under the leadership of music director Grant Llewellyn and conductor laureate Christopher Hogwood, the <b>Handel and Haydn Society</b>
 is a leader in historically informed performance, specializing in music
 for chorus and period orchestra from the Baroque and Classical eras. 
Each Handel and Haydn concert is distinguished by the use of 
instruments, techniques, and performance styles typical of the period in
 which the music was composed. Now in its 190th season, the Society has a
 long tradition of musical excellence. In the nineteenth century, Handel
 and Haydn gave the American premieres of Handel&#8217;s <i>Messiah</i> (1818), which the Society has performed every year since 1854, Haydn&#8217;s <i>The Creation</i> (1819), Verdi&#8217;s <i>Requiem</i> (1878) and Bach&#8217;s <i>St. Matthew Passion</i>
 (1889). Recent seasons have included collaborations with prominent jazz
 artists, a series of semi-staged operas, weekend-long festivals, and 
world and American premieres. The Society&#8217;s ambitious Educational 
Outreach Program brings the joy of classical music to more than 10,000 
students each. Handel and Haydn received a 2002 Grammy Award for its 
recording of Sir John Tavener&#8217;s <i>Lamentations and Praises.</i></p>
