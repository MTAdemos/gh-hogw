    <div class="title"><i>Duo Economique</i>: Graaf's austerity measures met with approval</div>
    <div class="date">May 7, 2010</div>
    <div class="leader">
A year ago, Christopher's edition of Christian Ernst <a href="archive-credit_crunch.htm">Graaf's <i>Duo Economique</i></a>
 (for two violinists on a single violin) offered an antidote, and an 
effective solution, to our straitened times. As the prospect of a hung 
parliament worries financiers, we continue to hear how the piece &#8212; 
published by <a href="http://www.editionhh.co.uk/shop/item.asp?itemid=471">Edition HH</a> &#8212; is catching on with performers and audiences throughout Europe.

From the audience's perspective, much of the appeal of the piece lies in
 watching the two performers grapple with the logistics, and most follow
 the solution described in Christopher's Introduction:
</p><p class="quote">
<i>The first violinist holds the violin and bows near the bridge, 
playing, for the most part, in third position (or higher) on the upper 
two strings; the second stands behind and bows nearer the fingerboard, 
playing in first position on the lower two (occasionally three) strings.</i>

In this way, Vreni Zeller and Edith P&#233;caut (right) recently performed the <i>Duo</i> to general amusement at the close of 
Fr&#252;hlings-Singwoche, Switzerland; and Barbara Doll und Winfried Rademacher's performance last year of the second movement at 
<a href="http://www.klassikfest.at/index.html">Klassik Musikfest M&#252;hlviertel</a>, Germany, can be seen on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Lmh70sbMto">YouTube</a>.

However, others have experimented to come up with alternatives to suit the particular players involved. Husband-and-wife team, <a href="http://stevebingham.co.uk/">Steve Bingham</a>
 and Brenda Stewart, reversed the position of the players for their 
Cambridge performance in May 2009, believed to be the modern premiere; 
and last month's performances in The Netherlands by members of the <a href="http://www.vanswietensociety.nl/calendar.php?id=32">Van Swieten Society</a>
 were even more adventurous: violist Bernadette Verhagen and cellist Job
 ter Haar played it, transposed, on viola, "standing opposite each 
other: Job ter Haar, our cellist, played on the neck as if it was a 
little cello"...
