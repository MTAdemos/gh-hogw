<p>
Published this week for the first time is an attractive and lyrical <i>Barcarolle</i>
 for solo cello with string orchestra and harp by the operetta and 
ballet composer Andr&#233; Messager, edited by Christopher for Edition HH. 
The autograph score recently came to light in the USA and is the 
composer's own adaptation of a <i>Barcarolle</i> for violin and piano he
 published in 1897. This is a welcome rediscovery for violinists too, 
for the original version is also included as part of the new edition. 
Both cellists and violinists will therefore have a choice of either 
piano or orchestral accompaniment.

Messager (1853-1929), a pupil of Faur&#233; and Saint-Sa&#235;ns, is known mainly for his theatrical works, including the operetta <i>V&#233;ronique</i> and the ballet
<i>Les deux pigeons</i>, but he was also, in his day, a reputed conductor, orchestrator, critic and administrator. He directed the premiere of Debussy's
<i>Pell&#233;as et M&#233;lisande</i> in 1902, and served as an artistic director at Covent Garden, London, between 1901 and 1907. His <i>Barcarolle</i> represents
a substantial addition to the instrumental legacy of a sadly neglected French master.<br><br><br>

</p><p>
Solo parts and scores of both versions are available in a single volume (HH238.SSP) from <a href="http://www.editionhh.co.uk/hh238cat.htm">Edition HH</a>,
as is a separate set of orchestral parts (HH238.IPT).</p>
