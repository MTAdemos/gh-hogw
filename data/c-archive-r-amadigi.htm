    <div class="leader">
In May Christopher conducted two performances of Handel&#8217;s early opera <i>Amadigi</i>
 with the Academy of Ancient Music. This marked the start of a 
three-year cycle of Handel operas with the AAM, featuring an opera from 
the 1710s in 2007; from the 1720s (<i>Flavio</i>) in 2008; and from the 1730s (<i>Arianna</i>) in 2009. 
These reviews appeared following the concerts in Birmingham and London.

<img class="imgleft" src="upload/larry-head-shot300adpidwnld1.jpg"><i>&#8220;Lawrence
 Zazzo, in the castrato role of Amadigi, sang with a sweet, expressive 
tone, while Patricia Bardon &#8212; as his rival Dardano &#8212; handled her cruelly
 low part with clarity and a rich bottom register. Klara Ek brought a 
touching simplicity to the drippish love-interest, Oriana. But Simone 
Kermes &#8212; as the sorceress Melissa, a lovesick baroque Queen of the Night
 &#8212; stole every scene in which she appeared. Exuberantly hamming it up, 
she snarled her trills, threw out peals of coloratura, and, in her Act 
Two duet with trumpeter David Blackadder, brought the audience cheering 
to its feet.

Glorious stuff. Yet what lifted this performance onto another level was 
what came between the set pieces. From the first bar of the overture, 
Christopher Hogwood let the music dance, relishing every detail of 
instrumental colour &#8212; whether pastoral recorders or the swirling 
harpsichord and theorbo continuo. The singers responded with recitatives
 as vivid and articulate as anything in Mozart.&#8221;</i>

<img class="imgleft" src="upload/kermes1.jpg"><i>&#8220;Many
 of its arias are formulaic expressions of vengefulness, perturbation 
and determination. Others, however, are simply gorgeous &#8212; the anguished 
&#8220;Ah! Spietato&#8221;, for example, or &#8220;Pene tiranno&#8221; with its sinuous oboe and
 bassoon obbligato. Four superb soloists &#8212; Lawrence Zazzo, Patricia 
Bardon, Simone Kermes (pictured) and Klara Ek &#8212; took every advantage of 
their big moments, and Christopher Hogwood conducted the Academy of 
Ancient Music with an expansiveness and buoyancy that may rank as 
old-school in the purists' book, but which certainly did the trick for 
me.&#8221;</i>

<i>&#8220;Though it fails to convince as musical drama, Amadigi di Gaula 
nevertheless forms an effective display piece for four fine singers, and
 this concert performance certainly provided us with some spectacular 
vocalism. The role of Melissa, in particular, requires a great diva, and
 proved to be something of a natural for the astonishing Simone Kermes, 
with her laser-like voice, mindblowing technique and thrillingly camp 
platform manner. Lawrence Zazzo's smugly noble Amadigi was sharply 
contrasted with Patricia Bardon's introverted, duplicitous Dardano. 
Klara Ek was the very elegant sounding Oriana. The playing, from the 
Academy of Ancient Music, was ravishing.&#8221;</i></p>
