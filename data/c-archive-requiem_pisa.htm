For the 11th year running, Pisa Cathedral plays host to the <i>Anima Mundi International Festival of Sacred Music</i>,
 giving audiences the opportunity to hear some of the most powerful and 
moving sacred works in one of the world's most breath-taking sacred 
spaces.  Christopher opened the festival on 17 September, directing 
Mozart's <i>Ave Verum</i> and <i>Requiem</i>, performed by the <i>Orchestra Maggio Musicale</i> and soloists.

Italian newspaper <i>La Repubblica Firenze</i> ranks Christopher's interpretation of the Mozart <i>Requiem</i>
 as a turning-point in the history of the composition.  Stripping away 
the marks left by years of 'romantic' interpretations and using an 
approach based on an understanding of the works' origins and genesis, 
Christopher brings the score to life with strong rhythms and "an inner 
wildness".

In the interview Christopher notes the great headway made by the 
exponents of historically-informed performance practice since the 1960s 
and how this approach has successfully permeated mainstream practices.
