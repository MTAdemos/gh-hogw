<img src="upload/olms3.jpg" alt="olms3.jpg" class="imgright" height="280" width="195">"Although
 Handel and Gottlieb Muffat never met, Muffat's name is well known to 
Handelians as the source of the extensive but unacknowledged 
'borrowings' Handel made in his <i>Ode for St. Cecilia's Day</i> and the Concerti Grossi op. 6, all deriving from Muffat's <i>Componimenti musicali</i> published in 1739. There are also modified quotations from Muffat in the op. 7 Organ Concerti and in <i>Judas Maccabaeus</i>, <i>Joshua</i>, <i>Solomon</i> and <i>Theodora</i>.
 The balance is redressed somewhat by considering Muffat's acknowledged 
'recreations' of Handel's most famous keyboard publications, the eight 
suites (<i>Suite de Pieces Pour le Clavecin</i>, first issued in 1720) 
and the set of fugues (<i>Six Fugues or Voluntarys</i> of 1735)".
</p><p>
The Handel originals have received much scholarly attention but this 
essay is the first on Muffat's valuable adaptations, which became 
available in print only with Christopher's editions for <a href="http://www.utorpheus.com/utorpheus/index.php">Ut Orpheus Edizioni</a> in 2007 (<a href="http://www.utorpheus.com/utorpheus/product_info.php?products_id=1565">suites</a>) and 2008 (<a href="http://www.utorpheus.com/utorpheus/product_info.php?products_id=1794">fugues</a>).
