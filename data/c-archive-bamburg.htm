A few interesting contrasts to report from June 2005&#8217;s travels. First in
 Germany, where rehearsals with the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra took 
place in Bamberg itself, though the concerts were all given in the 
Residenz in W&#252;rzburg, some 50 miles away.
</p><p>
Bamberg itself is that rare thing, a real old German town undamaged 
during the 20th century but still not so over-run with tourists as to be
 unbearable. Many well-preserved medi&#230;val streets, a very sympathetic 
University quarter, fine bridges (at least one of them, anyway) and a 
quiet river with ancient housing down to the water&#8217;s edge. An elegant 
old baroque hospital has been converted into a hotel and restaurant 
(complete with original Baroque Chapel)

Good menu, and imaginative variations even on asparagus at the height of
 the Spargel season; wine list with many local wines by the glass and 
(almost) music-free (very low level).
</p><p>
In the centre of the old town (50% antique shops) and by the river is 
the restaurant of the Hotel Bruderm&#252;hle, run by Georg Vogler and family.
 Dining either in the atmospheric (but not tarted-up) interior or &#8212; 
better for the summer &#8212; outside overlooking the river on the &#8220;idyllic 
terrace&#8221;. Good fish, especially local trout, and wines grown almost 
within sight of the tables.

W&#252;rzburg is a contrast to Bamberg in many ways, but visually largely 
because of war damage and reconstruction. Even the enormous baroque 
Residenz (to the design of Balthasar Neumann) is largely a post-war 
reconstruction (at the moment the Tiepolo staircase painting is being 
renovated and therefore not visible). But the music room still retains 
the atmosphere of an 18th century interior, and the view onto the formal
 terraced gardens improves as the evening wears on and the avenues of 
flares are lit. Long resonance for music, and a very long interval for 
garden promenades. The town itself is more utilitarian, but full of 
tourists, with consequently dire results on the restaurants. For 
post-concert dining, the only regular and reliable haunt I found was the
 Italian restaurant Bella Napoli, opposite the Hotel Rebstock (the 
oldest and nicest family-run hotel in town) in Neubaustrasse. Very firm 
in its own Italian ways (no quattro stagioni pizzas and not an anchovy 
in sight), but open until midnight (and what little background music I 
heard came from the kitchen where the chef obviously had a taste for 
mediaeval music and Bartok quartets). Again, wines are local and grown 
in the almost vertical vineyards that cover the steep slopes up to the 
Schloss.
</p><p>
Much more exotic contrast came last week with a concert in the Summer 
Festival in Istanbul; here again the march of muzak was apparent: in the
 nicest old Turkish-style hotel (The Green House &#8212; Yesil Ev &#8212; very close
 to the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia and Topkapi) now has wall-to-wall 
light music and Mozart playing rather too loudly all day, and so can no 
longer be recommended for its peaceful courtyard with fountains etc.: 
even the traditional hammams are &#8220;improved&#8221; with night-club music (and 
the two we checked &#8212; Cagaloglu and Cembalitas &#8212; also gave more desultory
 scrubs than previously). However, a great discovery was the roof 
terrace of the Armada Hotel, which has no music, fine Turkish food by 
candlelight and the city&#8217;s best views of all the main mosques plus a 
view over the Bosphorus to Asia (and the moon was the lowest and largest
 for the last 18 years the evening we happened to be there).

A must of a different order is a visit to the Anatolian House Restaurant
 and Caf&#233;, not far up the tramway street from the Blue Mosque; this is 
full of small restaurants in side streets, but none with owners to 
compare with Oktay who talks all passers-by into his establishment. Even
 when we said we were after no-music, he bowed like an opera star and 
waved us towards an adjacent restaurant (also his, same menu) and had 
the music turned off.
</p><p>
The next wavering diners to pass by were then told what an advantage it 
was to have no music to spoil their conversation &#8212; all with flourishes, 
bows, hand on heart and flow of patter to melt the stoniest heart. Both 
food and wine were excellent as well (with special discounts on 
absolutely everything &#8220;just for us&#8221;), but the sales-pitch is the finest 
thing.
