In its passage from manuscript composition to audible performance, a 
musical work passes through the hands of editors, teachers, 
interpreters, recording engineers and many others, all of whom make 
decisions, often based on personal choices, and have to satisfy the 
tastes and needs of a changing public. With over a century of recorded 
sound as evidence, we can now assess the options and expectations of the
 modern performer, and measure these against the evidence available to 
the interpreter today, and the range of choices to be made.

<a href="http://www.gresham.ac.uk/event.asp?PageId=45&amp;EventId=1112">St. Cecilia and Music: True or False?</a><br>
Why does music require a 'patron saint'? What are the qualifications of 
such a person, and how has the praise of a non-musical heroine 
contributed so much to our poetic and musical heritage: music ranging 
from Purcell and Handel to Benjamin Britten provides partial evidence, 
but the social and guild fabric of professional music-making has also 
benefited from the long-standing Annual Feasts.

<a href="http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/fakes-completions-and-the-art-of-borrowing">Fakes, Completions and the Art of Borrowing</a><br>
Although Mozart's unfinished Requiem is the most publicised composition 
requiring a helping-hand, there are many similar incomplete may-be 
masterpieces which have been assisted in some way, plus a number of 
well-loved classics which have very little connection with their 
supposed author ('Albinoni's Adagio' heads such a list). In addition 
composers of all periods have been open to the 'art of borrowing' - 
Handel was particularly active in this area and the reasons and results 
of his 'borrowings' shed a new light on some very familiar compositions.

<a href="http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/the-authenticity-of-genius">The Authenticity of Genius</a><br>
Although Mozart is the usual example of genius that springs to mind (a 
combination of youth and perfection), in this lecture Felix Mendelssohn 
is proposed as a more precocious example of the same qualities, with an 
even greater range of abilities (painting and languages in addition to 
both composing and performing). As a test case we will examine his Octet
 for Strings, Op. 20, written at the age of sixteen and performed for 
this lecture by players from the Royal Academy of Music.

Musical notation is both inexact and changeable; the assumptions of one 
period may be lost on following generations, and the greater part of 
written music still remains unpublished at the present day. The 
challenges of editing and presenting a text, either of a well-known 
classic or of an unknown writer differ in music from those faced in the 
similar worlds of literature or Biblical criticism. The dilemmas created
 by composers' second thoughts and revisions, and disciples' 
'improvements' require a 'correct' way of presenting obsolete 
information to the modern performer and raise questions which can both 
change our attitude to familiar works and resurrect forgotten treasures.

<a href="http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/from-printed-page-to-performance">From Printed Page to Performance</a><br>
When so much in music education is formulated on the principle of 
imitation, and the passing down of received 'traditions' from teacher to
 pupil, it is important to readdress the significance of original and 
informed opinion in performance.  Dame Emma Kirkby, who has done more 
than any other musician of our generation to reassess the vocal approach
 to earlier music will discuss with the Lecturer her approach to 
singing, teaching, recording and performing and the effect her 
performances have had on singing world-wide over the last forty years.

The lecture is illustrated by live examples taken from Renaissance lute 
songs and other repertoire, including pieces by John Dowland, Tarquinio 
Merula and Henry Purcell.</p>
