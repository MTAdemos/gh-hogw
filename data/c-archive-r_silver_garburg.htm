"Lyricism, flow and beauty, the hallmarks of so much of Mendelssohn&#8217;s 
music, are as integral to his two two-piano concertos as they are to his
 two concertos for solo piano. But the two-piano works are far less 
frequently performed, perhaps because they require the duo-pianists to 
subsume individual virtuosity into uniformity of sound and approach. 
These are not &#8220;display pieces,&#8221; but they are wonderful music &#8211; and when 
pianists are as comfortable with them (and apparently with each other) 
as are Sivan Silver and Gil Garburg, the results are exemplary. These 
two teachers from the Academy of Music in Hanover present readings of 
the concertos in E (1823) and A-flat (1824) that effectively balance the
 works&#8217; classical poise with their Romantic emotions. They are 
beautifully complemented by the chamber-size Bayerische 
Kammerphilharmonie, which Christopher Hogwood directs with the clarity 
and balance that have long been trademarks of his musical approach. The 
brighter (if not really frothier) Concerto in E comes across 
particularly well, being more strongly immersed in classicism than its 
slightly later companion. The Concerto in A-flat is more symphonic and 
has more of a Romantic temperament; it is less straightforward in both 
style and harmony. A larger ensemble would have worked well here, but 
the considerable clarity that Hogwood brings to this work makes an 
effective argument for keeping the accompaniment modest. Silver and 
Garburg also have a fine understanding of the differing scales of these 
two works, handling the one in E with positively Mozartean finesse while
 allowing the one in A-flat to emerge in larger scale and with greater 
scope. This CD is about as effective an argument as possible for 
more-frequent performances of these unfairly neglected and thoroughly 
winning works."
