Here below is the English version of a note written by Christopher especially for this re-release.
</p><p>
&#8220;The finest Composition of Musick that ever was heard"
</p><p>
For many music lovers, Handel's <i>Messiah</i> is to oratorio what the <i>Nutcracker</i> is to ballet, an entertainment without which no Christmas is complete. <i>Messiah</i>
 is certainly more than music; it has achieved cult status, as an icon 
of choral worship, and it often seems to have become more of a social 
ritual than a Christian experience. As listeners we are always audience,
 never congregation. Yet it possesses to an extraordinary degree those 
two most disparate elements of art, spontaneous power and premeditated 
plan, which never fail to ignite more than mere musical enthusiasm.
</p><p>
<i>Messiah</i> is not a typical Handel oratorio; there are no named 
characters, as were usually to be found in his settings of Old Testament
 stories, possibly to avoid charges of blasphemy. It is a meditation 
rather than a drama of personalities, lyrical in method; the narration 
of the story is carried on by implication, and there is no dialogue.
</p><p>
Credit for the compilation of this extraordinary text must be handed to 
Charles Jennens, an outspoken, and much maligned friend of Handel. He 
was a wealthy country gentleman, with a large country estate and an 
elegant London house. He hid neither his wealth, nor his views, and for 
his ostentation came to be known as "Solyman the Magnificent". The 
worthiness of Jennens' text is proved by the fact that although Handel 
over the years made changes to the music (usually in the interests of 
pacing, or the arrival of new solo voices), he hardly ever felt the need
 to add or subtract a single word.
</p><p>
After the first public rehearsal of <i>Messiah</i>, on April 9, 1742, the <i>Dublin Journal</i>
 reported that it "was allowed by the greatest Judges to be the finest 
Composition of Musick that ever was heard". Jennens was less than 
overwhelmed by the work; he declared to a friend: "His <i>Messiah</i> 
has disappointed me, being set in great hast[e], tho' he said he would 
be a year about it, &amp; make it the best of all his Compositions. I 
shall put no more Sacred Words into his hands, to be thus abus'd..."
</p><p>
Time, however, has proved <i>Messiah</i> to be immortal, though open to 
every vagary of interpretation. It has survived all indignities of 
amputation, truncation and re- orchestration, the use of elephantine 
forces and Wagnerian delivery -- even the foolish ritual of standing 
during, rather than after, the "Hallelujah" chorus, a habit that was 
first noted in the nineteenth century and has nothing to do with Handel.
</p><p>
To best represent Handel's intentions and vision, I would recommend 
making use of a text, both verbal and musical, that represents his 
unadulterated intentions (but still offers his alternatives) and allows 
him the sonorities he expected with boys&#8217; voices, period instruments, 
appropriate ornamentation and a real feeling for the drama of this 
timeless story.
