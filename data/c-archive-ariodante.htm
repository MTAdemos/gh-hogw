Handel&#8217;s Italian operas, about 40 in total, show a remarkable 
consistency in quality. He rarely wrote a bad opera, judged in terms of 
musical fluency and balance: on the other hand, there were peaks of 
excellence when Handel produced a run of outstanding works. One such 
peak comes at the height of the success of the Royal Academy opera 
company in 1724&#8211;5, with <i>Giulio Cesare</i>, <i>Tamerlano</i> and <i>Rodelinda</i>, and another about a decade later with <i>Arianna</i>, <i>Ariodante</i> and <i>Alcina</i>.
 The circumstances which brought forth the second group were very 
different from those of the relatively stable and confident Academy 
period. After a series of scares and alarms &#8212; in which power struggles 
in the political community of opera patrons, in the Royal family and in 
the musical profession played a part &#8212; a rival opera company to Handel&#8217;s
 was set up in London during 1733, with support from the Prince of 
Wales. During 1734 Handel lost his principal counterbalancing Royal 
supporter, Princess Anne, when she married Willem of Orange in March and
 took up residence in Holland. In December 1733 one well-informed 
observer had commented: &#8216;How two Opera Houses will subsist after 
Christmas, I can&#8217;t tell; but at present we are at some difficulty for 
the Support of One; &amp; Mr. Handel has been forc&#8217;d to drop his Opera 
three nights for want of company [i.e. for lack of audience].&#8217;
</p><p>
It was true enough that London&#8217;s opera audience in the 1730s was barely 
sufficient to support one company, and in the long term the fission of 
the mid-1730s destroyed Handel&#8217;s operatic career: things were never the 
same again. The (always tenuous) stability of patronage was lost, and 
with it the chance to develop a coherent long-term artistic policy. In 
the short term, however, Handel was preoccupied during the years 1733&#8211;5 
simply with the survival of his company from one season to the next.
</p><p>
The initial effects of the competition from the Opera of the Nobility 
were attenuated by the fact that, for the season of 1733&#8211;4, Handel 
retained a base at the King&#8217;s Theatre, Haymarket, which was London&#8217;s 
premier Italian opera house. This may have been the consequence of a 
five-year agreement with the Royal Academy directors in 1729 for the use
 of the theatre. No such security attached to the employment of the 
singers, however, and Handel lost nearly all of his best soloists to the
 Nobility company: of the stars, only the soprano Anna Maria Strada 
remained on his side. Since the singers constituted at least one third 
of the attraction for audiences (the other elements being the music and 
the settings) this was a serious matter. Most serious of all was the 
loss of his leading man, the famous castrato Senesino, to the rival 
company. The participation of a castrato <i>primo uomo</i> (&#8216;first man&#8217;)
 was an essential ingredient for the success of an Italian opera 
company, and fundamental to the conventions of the genre of Italian 
Baroque opera itself. The high voice symbolised, musically, the dominant
 role in the drama: tenors and basses, if they were included at all, 
were confined to secondary roles as (for example) priests, servants or 
old men. There were some exceptions but it was very rare for any lower 
voice to be given comparable dramatic and musical status to the leading 
castrato.
</p><p>
In order to obtain a replacement for Senesino, Handel had to set a 
system of communications in continental Europe to work for him: 
professional musicians living abroad played a part, but so did political
 diplomats, because leading opera singers were often employed in 
circumstances of direct political patronage. Handel was fortunate to 
secure Giovanni Carestini, who was in the midst of a successful career 
in Italy and, more recently, at Munich under the patronage of the 
Elector of Bavaria. Soon after Carestini&#8217;s first London appearance he 
was described by one opera-goer as &#8216;an extream good singer&#8217;, and the 
nature of his talent is apparent from the music that Handel wrote for 
him. While Senesino seems to have made his mark by combining 
musicianship with stage presence, Carestini may have relied more on 
straightforward musical virtuosity. Handel&#8217;s music for him includes many
 arias whose effectiveness depends on the swift and accurate delivery of
 semiquaver roulades, over an energetic and forward-thrusting harmonic 
framework. It was Carestini who is said to have initially resisted 
singing the aria &#8216;Verdi prati&#8217; in <i>Alcina</i> because its &#8216;simple&#8217; style did not display his talents. Arias such as &#8216;Con l&#8217;ali di costanza&#8217; and &#8216;Doppo notte&#8217; from <i>Ariodante</i>
 (the latter displaying Carestini&#8217;s full two-octave range from a to a" &#8212;
 Handel wrote for him in the soprano clef) we might describe as typical 
Carestini pieces, and they must have been thrilling for the original 
audiences. But Carestini could be forceful in other types of aria as 
well, such as &#8216;Scherza infida&#8217; in <i>Ariodante</i>, which must rank as 
one of the masterpieces in our gallery of Handel&#8217;s best musico-dramatic 
arias. The fact is that, particularly in <i>Ariodante</i>, Handel was 
able to couple Carestini&#8217;s musical talents with powerful dramatic 
situations: &#8216;Scherza infida&#8217; conveys the jealousy and desperation of 
Ariodante after the discovery of Ginevra&#8217;s supposed infidelity, while 
the other two major arias mark, respectively, Ariodante&#8217;s delight and 
confidence at the prospect of his union with Ginevra (though any 
experienced audience would suspect that such untrammelled bliss in Act 
One indicated trouble ahead), and his moment of conviction that his 
problems are nearing conclusion. The emotion released in these arias is 
expressed in directly proportional musical structures: Handel&#8217;s 
treatment of the da capo aria is here at its most expansive. The arias 
are long as well as demanding, and Carestini must have been a singer of 
considerable stamina. He was at the height of his physical powers &#8212; 
about 30 years old &#8212; when he sang Ariodante.
</p><p>
Handel&#8217;s new opera for the 1733&#8211;4 King&#8217;s Theatre season was <i>Arianna</i> and the programme also included a new serenata (<i>Parnasso in Festa</i>)
 to celebrate the Princess&#8217;s wedding, but the rest of the repertory 
consisted of revivals of operas and oratorios, adapted where necessary 
to the new cast. At the end of the season, Handel&#8217;s time at the King&#8217;s 
Theatre ran out, and the Nobility Opera moved in. Handel persuaded the 
theatre manager John Rich to allow him the use of the new theatre at 
Covent Garden for the next season. This was smaller and further away 
from the &#8216;West End&#8217; opera patrons than the Haymarket building, though it
 was near the famous Drury Lane theatre, but it proved entirely 
adequate. The move involved no musical compromises &#8212; Handel took his 
cast and, as far as we know, his full orchestra with him &#8212; and, if 
anything, he looked for ways of giving his operas additional attractions
 to lure the audiences away from the Nobility Opera. Principal among 
these additional attractions was a troupe of French dancers under the 
direction of Marie Sall&#233;. The theatre may also have been equipped for 
scenic effects of a rather different type from those at the Haymarket.
</p><p>
<i>Ariodante</i> was composed in the summer and early autumn of 1734, 
between the two seasons: this accorded with a common (and sensible) 
practice of Handel&#8217;s, to prepare a score before rehearsals started and, 
incidentally, while the natural daylight gave him a longer composing 
day. Normally, since Handel was a fluent and experienced operatic 
composer, he could turn out a three-act score within a month but in this
 case the process was unusually protracted. He began the overture, 
presumably at his Brook Street house, on August 12 and drafted the first
 two acts at something like his normal speed, finishing Act One on 
August 28 and Act Two on September 9. In a letter dated August 27 Handel
 spoke of having just returned from &#8216;the country&#8217;. There are some local 
anecdotes that sections of the opera were composed at Tunbridge Wells, 
but this seems rather unlikely for a man who liked to work surrounded by
 familiar objects and resources (including sources of inspiration in the
 way of musical &#8216;borrowings&#8217;), and it seems more likely that he took a 
short holiday before tying up Act One. After September 9, however, there
 was a gap, and the score was not completed until October 24.
</p><p>
One cause for the delay was almost certainly that Handel&#8217;s resources for
 the next season were only slowly clarified. The first two acts were 
orignally drafted for Lurcanio and Dalinda as soprano-clef and alto-clef
 roles respectively. These presumably related to Handel&#8217;s expectations, 
based on the singers from the previous season. Of the pre-season 
changes, the most significant was the arrival of an ex-chorister from 
the Chapel Royal, John Beard, for whom (as a tenor) the music of 
Lurcanio was adapted. The new singer for the role of Dalinda was also 
quite youthful, the soprano Cecilia Young, later to marry Thomas Arne. 
The incorporation of Beard into the company may have preceded that of 
Young, whose music seems to have been adapted at a later stage in the 
autograph&#8217;s development. The, provision of the dances was also a late 
task, probably undertaken after the main autograph had been completed. 
Fortunately the structure of the opera allowed for the introduction of 
ballets at the end of each act. In Acts One and Three the ballets are 
court entertainments, to be watched by the actor-singers. The 
arrangement at the end of Act Two is yet more cunning, as Ginevra&#8217;s 
distracted state conjures up visions which are represented by the 
dancers. It is uncertain whether Handel&#8217;s most ambitious scheme for the 
end to Act Two, concluding powerfully with a short accompanied 
recitative, was carried through to performance: the sources are rather 
confused, not least because Handel lifted the dances en bloc for re-use 
in his next opera, <i>Alcina</i> (as an incidental result, Ginevra&#8217;s 
final recitative was printed in the wrong opera during the nineteenth 
century). But in a modern performance this spectacular ending seems too 
good to miss.
</p><p>
Handel did not introduce <i>Ariodante</i> immediately into his Covent Garden season, which began in November 1734 with a revival of an old opera, <i>Il pastor fido</i>:
 this might be better described as a re-revival, for Handel had produced
 it earlier in the year with new music for Carestini, and now extended 
it further with a new prologue featuring the dancers. A revival of <i>Arianna</i> followed, and then <i>Oreste</i>,
 a full-length &#8216;self-pasticcio&#8217; opera of Handel&#8217;s music. He was keeping 
his best original work for the new year. The name of the opera had been 
known even before the season began, because a London newspaper had 
reported on November 4 that Handel had &#8216;waited upon their Majesties with
 his new Opera of Ariodante&#8217;. This was part of a successful bid to keep 
the Royal subsidy which had previously been given to Handel for 
productions at the King&#8217;s Theatre, and perhaps the King and Queen had 
some sort of preview performance on that occasion.
</p><p>
<i>Ariodante</i> came to the stage on January 8, 1735, and ran for 
eleven performances: there was also a brief revival the next season. For
 the original production, in addition to Carestini (Ariodante), Strada 
(Ginevra), Lurcanio (Beard) and Dalinda (Young), the leading singers 
included the contralto Maria Caterina Negri as Polinesso: Handel had no 
&#8216;second man&#8217; (that is, second castrato) in his cast, so this second male
 lead was played by a woman. The team was completed by the bass Waltz 
(as the King) and another tenor for the minor role of Odoardo.
