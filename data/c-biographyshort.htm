Christopher Hogwood, once described as "the von Karajan of early music",
 is equally active in 19th and 20th-century repertoire. A celebrated
conductor, musicologist and keyboard player, his catalogue of over 200
recordings with the Academy of Ancient Music on Decca includes the
complete Mozart and Beethoven symphonies. His Secret Handel CD &#8212; part of
 the "thrilling and revealing" series <i>The Secret Clavichord</i> &#8212; was recently awarded a <i>Diapason d'Or</i>
 and a series of neo-classical recordings with Kammerorchester Basel for
 Sony/BMG was described as "balanced and thought provoking with
beautifully pointed and incisively characterised performances". He has
worked with most leading symphony orchestras and opera houses in the
world. As a musicologist he covers music from the 16th (Fitzwilliam
Virginal Book) to the 20th (Martin&#367;, Elgar, Stravinsky) centuries, and
is currently re-editing the overtures and symphonies of Mendelssohn. A
revised edition of his classic biography of Handel &#8212; "a thorough and
excellent guide to the life and works of the great man" &#8212; was issued in
2007.
