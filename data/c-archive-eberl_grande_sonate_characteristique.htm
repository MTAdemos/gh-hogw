Grande Sonate Charact&#233;ristique <br>
in F minor, Op.12 <br>

</p><p>
Christopher's latest edition to be published by Edition HH is now available.
</p><p>
The <i>Grande Sonate Charact&#233;ristique</i> in F minor was published 
between Eberl's visits to Russia, and dedicated to Haydn, possibly in 
gratitude for his reported praise of Eberl&#8217;s opera <i>Die K&#246;nigin der schwarzen Inseln</i> which had 
just been staged in Vienna. Its more obvious target, however, might well have been Beethoven&#8217;s <i>Grande Sonate Path&#233;tique</i> which had appeared in 1799; the dotted rhythms of Eberl&#8217;s <i>Grave
maestoso</i> introduction pay clear tribute to the earlier work.
