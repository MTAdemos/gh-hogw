 the foremost representative of Czech music in 18th century Vienna, 
Leopold Ko&#382;eluch (1747-1818) was noted primarily as composer, pianist 
and keyboard teacher. His 50 keyboard sonatas cover his entire career 
and mark not only the transition from the harpsichord and clavichord 
manner to the fully idiomatic forte-piano style, but also the 
development of the "classical sonata" which spanned several decades 
(from 1773 to 1809). 
</p><p>
Until now, pianists have had little chance to acquaint themselves with 
the complete range of Ko&#382;eluch's sonatas since few existed in modern 
editions. For the first time this new complete edition by Christopher 
presents all sonatas for keyboard solo.  The sonatas are suitable for 
amateurs as well as professionals and are ideal for teaching purposes.  
The edition includes a detailed introduction, a critical commentary and 
facsimiles.</p>
