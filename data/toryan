    <div class="title CanNotDelete">Lost and found: Christopher's performances on folk albums from the 60s and 70s</div>

    <div class="leader">
In the process of expanding his online discography,
Christopher was delighted to rediscover several LPs of albums by folk
groups The Young Tradition and Shirley &amp; Dolly Collins, featuring
Christopher himself on the harpsichord.

    <p>
In a series of unusual but striking collaborations, these young folk
singers joined forces with players from the Early Music Consort on
period instruments, creating what Dolly Collins felt to be the "natural
orchestra" that her arrangements needed. So far we have unearthed copies
 of "Galleries", by The Young Tradition (1968), along with two albums by
 Shirley &amp; Dolly Collins, "Anthems in Eden" (1969) and "Love, Death
and the Lady" (1970).

Featuring a variety of what were then relatively little-known
instruments including viols, shawm, cornett, sackbut, crumhorns, along
with the harpsichord played by Christopher, these recordings have been
variously referred to as "freak folk" or "folk rock" and represented
something of a departure from Christopher's usual musical style!</p>

 is harsh primordial territory. Murder ballads, tales of wrong-doing and
 punishment meted out by an uncaring society do little to further the
perennial prejudice that all British folk is
<br>
'hey-nonny-no-under-the-greenwood' stuff... They're archetypes in which
all of our cultural expressions are rooted and, as such, transcend any
'Olde Englishe' stereotype you care to put on them. This is one album
that'll still be as relevant in a hundred years time. Haunting.</i><br>
