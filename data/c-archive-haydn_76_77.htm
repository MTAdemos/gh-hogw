<b>The composer</b>
</p><p>
Haydn&#8217;s reputation has fluctuated more, perhaps, than that of any other 
great composer. Before his London visits in the 1790s he was acclaimed 
throughout Europe. Following his death in 1809, his music came to seem 
tame to a century that exalted the confessional and the apocalyptic and 
he lagged behind Mozart and Beethoven.
</p><p>
One problem is the lack of Shaffer Amadeus-type romanticism in his 
biography. The son of a master-wheelwright, trained as a choirboy at St 
Stephen&#8217;s Cathedral in Vienna, Haydn was engaged by Prince Paul Anton 
Esterh&#225;zy in 1761 and served the family for the rest of his life.
</p><p>
In Haydn&#8217;s lifetime his music supremely represented moral and emotional 
depth. His great symphonies and quartets are among the marvels of 
civilised art, breathtaking in their expressive range and endlessly 
unpredictable in their structure. In our fractured age he has a power to
 uplift the spirit.
</p><p>
<b>The works</b>
</p><p>
Nowhere was Haydn&#8217;s music more popular than in London, where one 
newspaper even proposed that the composer should be kidnapped and 
&#8216;transplanted&#8217; to England.
</p><p>
The Earl of Abingdon had attempted to secure Haydn for his 1782&#8211;3 London
 concert season, announcing: &#8216;The Shakespeare of musical composition is 
hourly expected&#8217;. Though the visit never materialised &#8212; doubtless 
because Prince Nicolaus Esterh&#225;zy was reluctant to grant his 
Kapellmeister leave &#8212; its legacy is the set of three symphonies of 1782,
 Nos 76&#8211;78, intended for London. In a letter to the Paris publisher 
Boyer, Haydn advertised them as &#8216;beautiful, elegant and by no means 
over-lengthy... they are all very easy, and without too much concertante
 [i.e. soloistic passages for wind] for the English gentlemen&#8217;. Perhaps,
 for Haydn, the unusually suave surface of the trilogy&#8217;s two major-keyed
 symphonies, No. 76 and No. 77, represents a conscious attempt to woo 
the London public.
</p><p>
But in essence they continue the trend of Haydn&#8217;s music of the late 
1770s and early 1780s (especially the Op. 33 quartets), combining an 
easy tunefulness with a wonderfully subtle, sophisticated craftsmanship &#8212;
 a fusion of &#8216;popular&#8217; and &#8216;learned&#8217; styles that reached its apogee in 
the 12 great London symphonies.
</p><p>
<b><i>Symphony No. 77</i></b>
</p><p>
<b>Vivace</b><br>
The innocent opening, with its whiff of opera buffa, is deceptive: this 
is a closely argued movement, full of Haydn&#8217;s nonchalant contrapuntal 
mastery. There is a contrasting lyrical second theme, lightly scored for
 three-part strings shadowed by a bassoon. The development (2:57) 
&#8216;worries&#8217; the opening theme in a series of modulating imitations, and 
then tightens the screws in a passage of even closer canonic imitation. 
After a pause, the second theme ushers the music back to the home key 
for the recapitulation. Apart from the omission of the initial piano 
statement of the main theme, this remains regular until Haydn opens up 
surprising new vistas with a whimsical expansion of the second theme 
(from 4:48).
</p><p>
<b>Andante sostenuto</b><br>
This lovely movement, part rondo, part variations, evolves freely from 
the gracefully ornamented opening theme. The scoring, with muted violins
 and delicate woodwind colouring, has a chamber-music sensitivity; and 
as in the opening movement, Haydn uses the device of canonic imitation 
to intensify the music&#8217;s expression.
</p><p>
<b>Menuetto (allegro)</b><br>
Refined sentiment is summarily banished in the fast-paced minuet. With 
its stomping rhythms, offbeat accents and comic touches like the 
&#8216;fortissimo fart&#8217; at the start, this is more like a lusty German dance 
than an aristocratic one. The Trio is a lolloping L&#228;ndler, with a 
folk-style melody over an &#8216;oompah&#8217; accompaniment.
</p><p>
<b>Finale (allegro spiritoso)</b><br>
While the catchy opening tune suggests a rondo, the movement turns out 
to be in clear sonata form, with everything growing from the contour and
 rhythm of the fertile opening phrase. At the centre is a tense, 
brilliant contrapuntal tour de force (2:48) that caps even the first 
movement&#8217;s canonic development. But Haydn has further surprises up his 
sleeve in the coda where, in a rare moment of &#8216;concertante&#8217;, woodwind 
and horns give out a blunt, countrified version of the ubiquitous theme.
</p><p>
<b><i>Symphony No. 76</i></b>
</p><p>
<b>Allegro</b><br>
In typical galant style, the first subject alternates a vigorous call to
 attention and a gracious descending phrase in dotted rhythm; both 
elements are resourcefully developed. In the exposition the elegantly 
contoured second subject (1:14) grows from an apparently incidental 
phrase heard earlier (0:34). The development (3:35), varying and 
dissecting the two main themes through a wide spectrum of keys, contains
 one quietly audacious harmonic stroke. The recapitulation condenses 
much of the exposition to allow room for a new development of the first 
theme&#8217;s answering phrase.
</p><p>
<b>Adagio, ma non troppo</b><br>
 Like No. 77&#8217;s Andante, this is an amalgam of variations and rondo. 
Here, though, the structure is more clear-cut: a delicate, almost dainty
 B flat string melody, increasingly embellished on its later 
appearances, alternates with two minor-keyed episodes. The first, in B 
flat minor (1:31), is haunting both in its instrumental colouring and 
its dusky, Schubertian modulations. In sharp contrast, the G minor 
second episode (4:46), with its pounding staccatos and volleys of 
demisemiquavers, prefigures the G minor storms in the Andantes of the 
&#8216;Clock&#8217; and &#8216;London&#8217; symphonies. After the final appearance of the main 
theme, with a telling new harmonic twist (6:40), a quasi-cadenza recalls
 the turbulent figuration of the second episode.
</p><p>
<b>Menuet (allegretto)</b><br>
This is a more leisurely, courtly affair than the boisterous minuet of 
No. 77, though Haydn injects a moment of drama when the cadence of the 
first section is immediately repeated fortissimo in F minor. The Trio is
 another rustic L&#228;ndler, deliciously scored for flute, violins and 
bassoon in octaves, with the horns joining in where they can.
</p><p>
<b>Finale (allegro, ma non troppo)</b><br>
Continuing the urbane spirit of the whole symphony, Haydn writes a 
leisurely paced finale, built on a single theme of almost finicky 
elegance. The development (2:57) reveals the theme&#8217;s unsuspected 
strength in a sequence of imitations. As in the finale of No. 77, the 
coda (4:55) gives the unaccompanied woodwind a moment of glory in a 
series of tootling, Papageno-ish exchanges.
</p><p>
<b>CD key moments</b><br>
A track-by-track guide to Haydn&#8217;s Symphonies Nos 77 and 76
</p><p>
<b>Symphony No. 77</b><br>
<b>First movement (Track 1)</b><br>
Haydn&#8217;s transition to the recapitulation has a &#8216;Mozartian&#8217; smoothness 
and poise. The development&#8217;s strenuous canonic imitations are cut short 
by a Haydn-esque pause. The second theme reappears in a remote G major 
(3:35). Second violins start to repeat the theme in G minor (3:44), 
initiating a sequence of imitations that ease the music back to B flat 
and recapitulation (3:57).
</p><p>
<b>Second movement (Track 2)</b><br>
The expressive climax in a movement that transforms galanterie into pure
 enchantment begins at 2:53. The opening phrase is intensified in a 
ravishing series of overlapping imitations, with flute, oboes and 
bassoon adding delicate washes of colour to the string lines. Even 
subtler is the moment shortly afterwards (3:39) where the &#8216;stray&#8217; G flat
 at the end of the theme&#8217;s first half prompts a breathtaking dip from 
the tonic, F, to D flat.
</p><p>
<b>Symphony No. 76</b><br>
<b>First movement (Track 5)</b><br>
This symphony cultivates an air of genial sophistication, untroubled by 
darker emotions or knotty compositional &#8216;problems&#8217;. There are moments 
for the connoisseur in the harmonic sleight-of-hand in the development 
(from 4:10). The music settles on the brink of D flat, and then the rug 
is pulled from the listener as the music pivots to E flat.
</p><p>
<b>Fourth movement (Track 8)</b><br>
As in No. 77&#8217;s first movement, Haydn makes something special of the 
moment of recapitulation. But here the means are different. The 
development&#8217;s forceful climax leads to a pause; then the tripping theme 
begins in its original texture but in the &#8216;wrong&#8217; key of C minor (3:53),
 stops in its tracks, and, with no harmonic preparation, resumes in the 
proper key of E flat.</p>
