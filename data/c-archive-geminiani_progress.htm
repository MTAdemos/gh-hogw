In April the first volume of an important new venture appeared, the publication of <i>Geminiani Opera Omnia</i> by Ut Orpheus Edizioni of
Bologna, with the collaboration of the &#8220;Centro Studi Opera Omnia Luigi Boccherini&#8221; of Lucca.  

</p><p>
This venture, which has been in preparation for several years, will 
present all the works of Geminiani (1687-1762) &#8211; instrumental, vocal and
 didactic &#8211; in full critical editions, to celebrate the 250th 
anniversary of the composer&#8217;s death in 2012.  It will contain all 
authentic works by Geminiani that are known to survive, as well as 
selected works of uncertain authenticity; demonstrably spurious works 
are omitted.  The composer&#8217;s first versions, revisions, arrangements and
 re-workings will be presented consecutively by opus number, in addition
 to his adaptations of works by his teacher, Corelli.  
</p><p>
Although Geminiani, born in Lucca, was held to be the equal of Corelli 
in his own day &#8211; and indeed thought by some to be superior to his 
contemporary Handel in instrumental composition- his considerable output
 of music and didactic writings has only been available in piecemeal 
fashion, much of it never reissued since his lifetime except in 
facsimile, and thus largely inaccessible to the modern performer.  This 
lack of material designed for practical performance has concealed the 
enormous originality he showed both in writing and re-writing his own 
music, and that of Corelli.  <i>Francesco Geminiani Opera Omnia</i> 
rectifies this omission with the first uniform and accurate scholarly 
edition of all versions of his music and writings in a form that allows 
pertinent comparison and re-evaluation.  
</p><p>
The first volume to appear contains the Op. 5 sonatas for cello and 
continuo, and also the first modern edition of their arrangement by the 
composer as violin sonatas.  The second volume, just published by Ut 
Orpheus Edizioni, presents three sets of Geminiani concertos in their 
first editions since the eighteenth century: 6 Concertos after Corelli 
Opp. 1 &amp; 3 (1735); 3 Concertos from <i>Select Harmony</i> (1734); and 2 Unison Concertos (1761).  
</p><p>
The next few volumes, which will appear in the course of this year will 
include full orchestral concerti (Op. 7), and his important treatises on
 harpsichord accompaniment and the cultivation of True Taste.  It is 
hoped that the volume containing his most important tutor, <i>The Art of Playing on the Violin</i>, will also be able to appear in 2010.  
</p><p>
Further collections of sonatas, the important collections of concerti 
grossi (Opp. 2 and 3) and the collections of keyboard music will appear 
over the next two years, and the project will be rounded off by the 
publication of a Thematic Catalogue, both in book form and via the 
internet.</p>
