Though celebrating their respective 250th and 350th 
anniversaries, Handel (d. 1759) and Purcell (b. 1659) are in some 
respects still much misunderstood, a state of affairs addressed in two 
articles in NEMA&#8217;s 2009 <i>Yearbook</i>.

<img src="upload/handel.jpg" alt="handel.jpg" class="imgleft" height="416" width="349">In
 the first, Christopher, NEMA&#8217;s President, reminds us of the 
unparalleled esteem in which Handel was held by his contemporaries and 
by the likes of Beethoven in the nineteenth century, and regrets the 
ignorance with regard to Handel&#8217;s operas that has unjustly sullied the 
composer&#8217;s reputation in more recent times. 
</p><p>
In the second article, Andrew Woolley demonstrates the significance of 
even the most spurious of Purcellian works to be included in the 
forthcoming Purcell Society edition of the <i>Complete Keyboard Music</i>, edited by Christopher.

<b><i>In celebration of Handel (1685 &#8211; 1759)</i><br>
Christopher Hogwood</b><br>
</p><p>
<i>We are delighted to be able to open our collection of brief essays 
with one by our President, the first of three anniversary articles in a 
bumper year. Christopher Hogwood needs no introduction as a performer, 
scholar or Handel expert. Here he reflects on Handel&#8217;s significance and 
hints at a still little explored area of his input.</i>
</p><p>
In 2009 we have more than the usual number of major musical 
anniversaries to honour: Purcell, Handel, Haydn and Mendelssohn are on 
everyone&#8217;s list &#8211; and all to be f&#234;ted here with special patriotism for 
the work they did in England. More names can be added according to 
personal preference: I will be adding Martinu to the previous four (well
 out of NEMA&#8217;s range), but some will be celebrating the births of 
Charles Avison, Elisabeth Jacquet de la Guerre, Devienne and Franz 
Benda, or commemorating the deaths of Torelli, Graun and Eustache du 
Caurroy, plus others we as yet know not of.
</p><p>
So why a special bottle of champagne for Handel? Well, he chose to be 
English, so we have a special obligation. He was also the most 
voluminous of our candidates (in all senses); remember the old 
librarians&#8217; measurement which noted that Handel&#8217;s music covered more 
shelf inches than all Bach and all Beethoven put together. And although 
he became an established classic within his own lifetime, with the rare 
honour of a statue erected while he was still alive to see it, he never 
relaxed his fierceness for improvement. Rather like those marathon 
winners who, despite leading the field by a mile, nevertheless manage a 
final sprint in order to better their own timing, Handel never took 
things easily or assumed that an old formula would work again or 
imagined that he had an immunity from criticism or exemption from the 
sheer hard work of composing.
</p><p>
We have today lost the knack of praising Handel with the ease of the 
19th century.  Beethoven on his deathbed simply pointed at his Arnold 
edition of Handel and declared &#8216;Das ist das wahre&#8217; &#8211; &#8216;that is the 
truth&#8217;. Dean Ramsey in 1862 declared that &#8216;The works of Haydn, 
Beethoven, Mozart, Mendelssohn, Spohr and others &#8211; great masters &#8211; are 
performed, and they are admired, and justly so, but they have not the 
hold upon the taste and feelings (of Englishmen at least) that Handel 
has&#8217; &#8211; adding, in a pre-echo of Elvis-mania: &#8216;He is the greatest, and 
the favourite. He stands alone&#8217;.
</p><p>
However, both these tributes (and many others of the time) were made in 
complete ignorance of Handel in his favourite milieu &#8211; the opera house. 
 It was the sublimity of the vast religious choruses and the public 
ceremonial which moved men to tears and ladies to fainting. Quite what 
they would have made of Cleopatra or Agrippina (especially if they had 
removed all their clothing as they routinely do today) beggars the 
imagination. Rather perversely, it was the revival of Handel operas in 
the early 20th century that began to shake our confidence in his 
universality; they were quickly pronounced &#8220;incompatible&#8221; with modern 
theatre, and frequently oratorios would be staged as if they were operas
 (but with the intrinsic inconveniences of fixed choruses and miraculous
 happenings) doing nothing to forward the idea of drama, and landing 
Handel with (of all things) a reputation for being statuesque in the 
theatre. To a certain extent, this prejudice still prevails, and too 
often we find productions of the operas which feel they have to 
apologize for the music with nudity, helicopters and syringes.
</p><p>
It will be an uphill struggle to escape this unjust impression &#8211; but in 
the meantime, why not rescue that other great arena of dramatic and 
virtuoso vocal music, the private cantata, which the young Handel 
delivered so flamboyantly, and the older Handel borrowed from so 
regularly? Here we have a field of economic compactness, unsullied by 
theatrical directors&#8217; egos (as yet), and free from cant and cosmetic 
&#8216;up-dating&#8217;, we encounter the same characteristics of the Handel that 
the 19th century so enjoyed &#8211; &#8216;Sublimity and grandeur, perfection of 
sweetness and tenderness, the beauties of extreme simplicity and those 
of marvellous learning and intellectual power&#8217; (Alfred Whittingham, <i>The Life and Works of Handel</i>, London, 1882).

<b><i>Henry Purcell (1659-1695): his keyboard music and the forthcoming revised Purcell Society edition</i><br>
Andrew Woolley</b>
</p><p>
<i>For our second anniversary article we celebrate the 350th anniversary
 of that &#8216;divine genius&#8217;, Henry Purcell, one of England&#8217;s greatest 
native composers. Andrew Woolley has recently completed his Ph.D. on 
English keyboard music and its sources from the late 17th and early 18th
 centuries, under the supervision of Peter Holman at Leeds University.</i>
</p><p>
Much of Henry Purcell&#8217;s keyboard music is familiar today (or to keyboard
 enthusiasts at least). Howard Ferguson&#8217;s 1964 edition of the 
harpsichord music remains readily available (published by Stainer and 
Bell), and pieces such as the well-known &#8216;Cibell&#8217; (the most common 
keyboard arrangement of which may not actually have been composed by 
Purcell) are occasionally found in popular anthologies. The most 
important and representative source is the posthumous <i>A Choice Collection of Lessons for the Harpsichord or Spinnet</i>,
 first published in 1696, which contains the &#8216;eight suites&#8217;, a group of 
pieces probably dating from the mid- to late-1680s to about 1694. 
Nevertheless, other sources contain a number interesting works, notably a
 small number for organ. Three are of principal importance: Henry 
Playford&#8217;s collection <i>The Second Part of Musick&#8217;s Hand-maid</i> 
(1689), a manuscript probably dating from the 1680s (Oxford, Christ 
Church, MS Mus. 1177), and a recently discovered autograph containing 
several known pieces in new versions and new transcriptions of the 
composer&#8217;s theatre music (British Library, MS Mus. 1).
</p><p>
An editor of this music faces several difficulties relating not only to 
the authenticity of the pieces (an issue common with the music of almost
 any 17th century keyboard composer) but also with the text, as many 
pieces survive in several different versions. Christopher Hogwood, 
editor of the forthcoming Purcell Society edition, first published in 
1895, has adopted a refreshing &#8216;open doors&#8217; policy where the 
authenticity of the pieces is concerned, which seems appropriate for the
 repertoire: &#8216;the current mood is not only less proscriptive than 
previously, but also more sympathetic to a view based on standards of 
&#8220;purity&#8221; <i>then</i> rather than now&#8217; (&#8216;The &#8220;Complete Keyboard Music&#8221; of Henry Purcell&#8217;, <i>The Keyboard in Baroque Europe</i>,
 ed. C. Hogwood, Cambridge 2003, 76). The new edition will present 
pieces in multiple versions simultaneously, principally the harpsichord 
suites, which survive in different versions in the autograph, in <i>A Choice Collection</i>, and in <i>The Second Part of Musick&#8217;s Hand-maid</i>.
 Moreover, it will be inclusive, reflecting the relaxed approach taken 
by contemporary musicians to authorship. The previous Purcell Society 
edition, edited by W. Barclay Squire (harpsichord music) and Edward J. 
Hopkins (organ music), and Howard Ferguson&#8217;s 1964 edition of the 
harpsichord music excluded some works on musical and source-based 
grounds, and some important resources, principally of transcriptions, 
were not available when they were produced.
</p><p>
The popularity in his own time of Purcell&#8217;s keyboard music, or 
transcriptions/settings of his music (e.g. settings of consort or vocal 
pieces), is apparent from the large number of contemporary sources that 
survive. Settings of Purcell&#8217;s theatre music were particularly popular, 
and it seems likely that many composers besides Purcell were responsible
 for them (being sources of &#8216;Purcell&#8217;s keyboard music&#8217; in a loose 
sense). Indeed, Purcell himself set a hornpipe by John Eccles in the 
autograph (and other autographs of the same period contain settings of 
tunes by a mixture of composers). Several good sources of settings were 
compiled by composers, notably Philip Hart&#8217;s manuscript compiled for 
Essex Deane (Edinburgh, National Library of Scotland, Inglis 94 MS 
3343). Another notably example is in the William Andres Clark Library, 
Los Angeles (M678 M4 H295 1710), which is also likely to have been 
compiled by a professional keyboard composer-performer for teaching an 
amateur. Although their connection to Purcell is tenuous, the 
transcriptions in these manuscripts and others like them will be 
included in the new edition; at least their inclusion will serve to 
illustrate the posthumous popularity of Purcell&#8217;s music over the period 
c.1695 &#8211; 1705.
</p><p>
In addition to containing all known transcriptions, the revised edition 
will include several original keyboard works omitted from previous 
editions. Notable among them is the so-called <i>A major Toccata</i> 
(ZD229), which was included in the 1895 edition, but has since been 
subject to a great deal of debate over its likely authorship. If it were
 to be included, however, &#8216;it is very possible that a work so much 
discussed might soon not exist in any reputable edition at all&#8217; 
(Hogwood, &#8216;The &#8220;Complete Keyboard Music&#8221;&#8217;, 85). Other notable pieces for
 inclusion are those in the William A. Barrett MS (British Library, Add.
 MS 41205), an almand-corant-almand in A minor (Z642/1-2 and ZD218) and 
an almand-corant-saraband in B flat major (Z664). These pieces were 
omitted from the 1895 edition as the Barrett MS was not available, and 
Ferguson rejected them as &#8216;spurious&#8217; on musical grounds. As a result, 
five have not appeared in print since Ernst Pauer included them in his 
anthology <i>Old English Composers for the Virginals and Harpsichord</i>
 (1879), and one of them (ZD218) has apparently never been printed. 
Their inclusion in the new edition will be particularly welcome: whilst 
the harmonic eccentricities of Z664 are curious, the A minor pieces are 
fine and deserve to be better known.
</p><p>
For various reasons the revised edition has had a long gestation period,
 but it is hoped it will be finished in time for the anniversary of 
Purcell&#8217;s birth (which occurred in either 1658 or 1659).  In some ways 
it has been worth the wait as a number of new sources have come to 
light, or have become readily available, relatively recently (such as 
manuscripts now in the Foundling Hospital Museum Library formerly 
belonging to the late Gerald Coke). Certainly the &#8216;open doors&#8217; policy of
 the edition will offer opportunities for musicians to explore this 
repertory in a new light.</p>
