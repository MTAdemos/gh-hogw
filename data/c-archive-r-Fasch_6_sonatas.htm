 in Zerbst, Carl Fasch (1736-1800) came to be regarded as the successor 
to C. P. E. Bach at the court of Frederick the Great. Kirnberger 
glowingly described Fasch's playing: 'I have never heard Sebastian 
[Bach's] music better played than by him, and the music of the Hamburg 
Bach he played even better.' Despite this, Fasch is reputed to have been
 something of a recluse, whose self-criticism led him to destroy many of
 his own compositions.

Christopher Hogwood continues his excellent series of editions for 
Edition HH with this publication of Fasch's Six Sonatas, the first 
volume in a projected Complete Keyboard Works. These pieces date from 
around the 1760s. Each was published individually during the composer's 
lifetime, but they only appeared together as a set in 1805, five years 
after his death. In style the music is perhaps somewhere between C. P. 
E. and early Beethoven, but less technically difficult than the latter. 
As one might expect, there is a lucidity to the texture with 
part-writing that is largely in two or three parts.
</p><p>
This edition is both practical and elegant; the volume opens out easily 
since it is spiral-bound in metal (rather than plastic which often 
snaps). The music is printed on good-quality cream-coloured paper, which
 is less tiring on the eye than white paper. There is a useful 
introduction in both English and German replete with a biographical 
overview of the composer, table of ornaments, description of the 
sources, editorial method, and a section on performance issues and 
instruments &#8212; including a contemporaneous review that discusses whether 
the clavichord or the fortepiano would be most appropriate for 
performance. Five facsimiles from the composer's autographs and the 1756
 Haffner edition of Sonata No. 1 are sprinkled through the volume, which
 concludes with sixteen pages of critical commentary. Alternative 
versions are occasionally provided within the music itself, and both 
versions of the third sonata's concluding Presto are included.
</p><p>
Given how user-friendly this edition is, it might have been welcome to 
indicate the range (often over five octaves) at the start of each 
sonata. In an ideal world, a protective plastic cover could prove 
useful. But these trifling observations are only given in the light of 
my belief in this brilliant edition's imminent popularity.
