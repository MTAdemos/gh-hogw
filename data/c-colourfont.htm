This page is intended to allow some experimenting over fonts and colours.
On the left is a list of fonts: clicking on one of them should cause the text here to change font.
With web fonts, as with fonts for print, the font size specified doesn&#146;t correlate directly
to the actual size of the characters, so I&#146;ve added some code to minimise the apparent diferences
in font sizes so that comparison is easier.

<p>
Below are two colour-pickers &#151; one to allow the colour of the green background above to be
changed
and the other to change the colour of the lettering which is presently in yellow.
The colour picker is in two parts: on the right is a rectangular stripe with a white
slider on it: moving that up and down changes the basic colour.
As you move that slider it changes the colour in the box on the left: which
shows how the colour chosen (whch appears in the top right corner) can fade to white (top left)
or black (bottom). When you click &#147;choose&#148; the colour chosen replaces
the relevant part of what is at the top.
</p>

<p>
The colours chosen are shown as numbers in the box above the &#147;choose&#148; button: to say
which colours you like, could you record these numbers? It is also possible to type a number there
to go back to a colour you have previously looked at (a background colour I am wondering about is
a brown &#151; #65331f), which sends me to a site I did a while,
