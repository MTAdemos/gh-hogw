<b>
Getting a Handel on <i>Messiah</i> &#8212; Two new <i>Messiah</i> 
recordings aim to reconstruct Handel&#8217;s performances &#8212; an approach 
pioneered by Christopher Hogwood in his trailblazing 1980 account, says 
David Vickers, writing in <i>Gramophone</i> magazine for November 2006.</b>
</p><p>
<i>Messiah</i>, intended by its libretto-compiler Charles Jennens and 
the composer as a timely celebration for Lent, has become inseparable 
from Christmas (though only a portion of the first of its three parts 
has relevance to the festive season). Several fine new recordings have 
been released just in time for this year&#8217;s Yuletide celebrations. Edward
 Higginbottom (director of the Choir of New College, Oxford) and John 
Butt (artistic co-director of the Dunedin Consort) have each opted to 
reconstruct one of Handel&#8217;s own performances, but this policy started in
 earnest with Christopher Hogwood&#8217;s trailblazing 1980 recording with his
 Academy of Ancient Music and the Choir of Christ Church Cathedral, 
Oxford. Hogwood admits that &#8220;<i>Messiah</i> had been over-recorded even 
in those days, so there was a sort of pressure from our recording 
company not to do the same version.&#8221; He decided to reconstruct the only 
one of Handel&#8217;s own versions for which there is a lot of documentary 
information about the constitution of the orchestra and choir, and 
surviving performance material. Hogwood points out that this &#8220;naturally 
led to the account books and surviving performing parts for the 
performances at the Foundling Hospital in 1754&#8221;.
</p><p>
Back in 1980, we had not yet been bullied into denying the idealism and 
excitement that period instruments bring to &#8220;early&#8221; music. Hogwood&#8217;s <i>Messiah</i>
 was revolutionary and revelatory, with its dynamic championing of 
period instruments, the precise clarity of choral contributions, and 
stylishly natural soloists. Hogwood remembers that &#8220;In those days the 
vast majority of listeners were used to hearing cut <i>Messiahs</i>, so 
just to hear every piece was a surprise for a lot of people.&#8221; Not only 
that, but the actual musical text Handel performed at the Foundling 
Hospital in 1754 included some substantial differences to earlier and 
more familiar arrangements: a blistering high soprano version of &#8220;But 
who may abide&#8221; was sung with tremendous energy and intensity by Emma 
Kirkby, and David Thomas theatrically swept all asunder in the curtailed
 version of &#8220;Why do the nations&#8221; that launches suddenly into the chorus 
&#8220;Let us break their bonds&#8221; via a fleeting accompanied recitative. There 
were also subtle issues about Handel&#8217;s 1754 performances to be resolved.
 Hogwood mentions that &#8220;the oddity is two horns &#8212; what did they play? We
 know they were there, but there is no independent part for them. We 
tried using them to double the trumpets an octave below. Whether that is
 right or wrong nobody is quite sure, but I don&#8217;t think anybody has ever
 complained since!&#8221; Another vital ingredient was a sense of theatrical 
pacing and flow that had seldom been captured before. Hogwood says: &#8220;We 
made sure there weren&#8217;t great gaps between movements. I do like 
continuity without too much space for you to open your handbag and find a
 cough sweet!&#8221;
</p><p>
Hogwood acknowledges that in those days the AAM &#8220;benefited very much 
from Decca being proactive and sympathetic about getting things going. 
It was produced by Peter Wadland, who was always very scrupulous. 
Everybody was happy that it hung together, but nobody had any idea that 
the public would like it.&#8221; But the recording sessions were not as 
idyllic as the fantastic recording might have led us to believe: &#8220;During
 the sessions we had a big row with the Musicians&#8217; Union, and we were 
blacked off by the union. I never belonged to the union anyway, so we 
stood our ground. But for a long time I was not allowed to perform with 
my own orchestra, so we made TV recordings with a locked door in case 
the shop stewards came in.&#8221;
</p><p>
Thankfully, the AAM has survived. During the intervening years three participants in Hogwood&#8217;s recordings of <i>Messiah</i>
 (a later performance was filmed with the Choir of Westminster Abbey) 
have produced their own impressive recordings of the work: William 
Christie (Harmonia Mundi 10/94), Roy Goodman (leading his Brandenburg 
Consort for Stephen Cleobury; Argo, 12/94) and Harry Christophers 
(8/87R). The rich legacy of the AAM&#8217;s <i>Messiah</i> has been 
reinventing itself ever since. Now, after 26 years, the orchestra has 
recorded the oratorio again in very different circumstances.
</p><p>
The AAM 2006 upgrade is directed by Edward Higginbottom, who celebrates 
his 30th anniversary at the helm of his New College Choir. He observes 
that &#8220;the way the record industry has gone in the last 10 years, the 
opportunity to do iconic works has receded. So to celebrate my 30 years 
here I decided to bankroll a <i>Messiah</i> which I&#8217;ve then sold to 
Naxos.&#8221; Higginbottom pays tribute to the AAM: &#8220;It is the oldest of our 
early music orchestras, and that counts for something: it says that its 
roots are deep, it comes with all that Christopher Hogwood has given to 
it, and with tremendous experience of many repertoires.&#8221;
</p><p>
As with Hogwood in 1980, Higginbottom wanted his <i>Messiah</i> to be 
different. &#8220;We selected the 1751 version, when Handel decided he would 
use boys from the Chapel Royal for the solos as well as in the chorus. 
Handel also used tenor and bass soloists who had originally trained in 
the same background. You can see how it knits in with how we wanted it 
to celebrate a choral foundation. It is intriguing for me to take a 
contemporary organisation &#8212; my own choir and some former members &#8212; and 
contextualise it in a historical performance that Handel gave.&#8221;
</p><p>
Whereas Hogwood wanted to reconstruct Handel as closely as possible and 
promote period instruments, Higginbottom&#8217;s work with the AAM has a new 
agenda: &#8220;My motive was first and foremost to showcase New College Choir.
 It is a testament to my deep conviction that boys&#8217; choir activity in 
the UK is a very special thing. I am not sure people know that. It is 
one of those things that if we don&#8217;t celebrate it then in 10 years&#8217; time
 it might not be here. There are huge problems in running a boys&#8217; choir 
anywhere in Europe these days, and it was very much in my mind that this
 would signal that these are very precious commodities. We should look 
after them; we should cherish them.&#8221;
</p><p>
In 1980 Decca underwrote Hogwood&#8217;s technical and artistic costs, but 
times have changed and now artists must find the money themselves. A 
novel element of the New College <i>Messiah</i> project is that a clever
 chorister parent came up with the idea of auctioning each movement to 
sponsors in order to raise the funds to make the recording.
</p><p>
By an amazing coincidence, the Dunedin Consort simultaneously hit upon a
 similar strategy to fund their magnificent new recording for Linn 
Records. John Butt, a renowned Bach scholar and harpsichordist, observes
 that the idea to use subscriptions &#8220;has a historical ring to it. The 
concept was very much around in Handel&#8217;s time, so we did our 
subscription with all the old-fashioned lettering and all the old turns 
of phrase, as if we were selling it back in the 18th century!&#8221;
</p><p>
Butt played continuo on the innovative Harmonia Mundi USA recording of <i>Messiah</i>
 under Nicholas McGegan (10/91), yet another alumnus of Hogwood&#8217;s 
early-1980s AAM. This project included most of the variants from 
Handel&#8217;s different versions, and Butt fondly remembers that &#8220;it gave me 
an idea of some of the possibilities. I got hooked! Part of my interest 
in historical performance is trying to recover something of the surprise
 of music. I wonder what must it have sounded like for the very first 
time in Dublin. Handel was fresh to the piece and there are some big 
differences in original movements that we seldom hear now.&#8221; The Dunedin 
Consort &#8220;have done several things that bring out the newness, excitement
 and spontaneity of that event&#8221;. Butt has deliberately not listened to 
other recordings of <i>Messiah</i> while working on his project; but he 
says that Hogwood&#8217;s classic AAM performance &#8220;was a great inspiration to 
me when it came out. When you listen back to the AAM&#8217;s recordings from 
that period they are surprisingly subtle and flexible; radical in a 
quiet way&#8221;.
</p><p>
The Dunedin Consort bear Hogwood&#8217;s torch when it comes to researching 
documentary evidence, reconstructing the size and constitution of 
Handel&#8217;s performing forces and using the scientific approach to 
reinforce spectacular and provocative artistic results. Those accustomed
 to the grand choral society tradition or even chamber choirs of about 
30 singers will be shocked to learn that Handel&#8217;s first <i>Messiah</i> 
was probably sung by only about a dozen voices, including seven soloists
 whom Handel expected to sing in all the choruses. The Dunedin Consort 
bravely take the plunge to perform <i>Messiah</i> in exactly this way. 
&#8220;You can do things that you wouldn&#8217;t normally be able to do, and a 
consort of 12 singers cannot possibly sing <i>Messiah</i> choruses on 
autopilot. They really have to take a specific stance on the whole 
concept of affect, which so many people talk about in Baroque music 
without necessarily being able to realise it. The concept of rhetoric 
was so much in the education of Handel: a sense of how the text really 
is part of the music. It&#8217;s not just stuck on.&#8221; However, Butt is also 
aware that &#8220;it is so easy to get things too proscribed. So I tried to 
make people mark as little as possible in their copies, so that they 
remembered certain key principles and could then play with them. 
Directing from the harpsichord meant I didn&#8217;t have to literally conduct 
all the time, and a certain amount of non-direction forces musicians to 
concentrate and work together with a greater sense of focus and visual 
interaction&#8221;. The Dunedin Consort&#8217;s sensitivity to text and their desire
 to make the music fresh in the most intelligent manner is arguably the 
firmest way in which this harks back to Hogwood&#8217;s AAM 26 years ago.
